Welcome to the second issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Rust Roguelike Tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook)

![TODO: local, description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebracket/rltk_rs/master/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE06.gif)

Chapter 11 (save/load) and Chapter 12 (delving deeper) of my
Rust Roguelike tutorial are now live.
Now with the correct hashtags, sorry about that.

<https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_12.html>

<https://twitter.com/herberticus/status/1171490191426473984>

My Rust Roguelike tutorial has grown to 20 chapters!
From "hello rust" and "what is an ECS?" to adding monsters, equipment,
multiple levels, bloodstains, particle effects and magic mapping scrolls.

<https://twitter.com/herberticus/status/1172202143253708800>

Chapter 21 of the Rust Roguelike Tutorial uses it to make
the main menu less boring!

- Amethyst Engine v0.13:

  Amethyst is a game engine and tool-set for ambitious game developers. It enables game developers to make complex games without getting into too much trouble, by means of a data-driven design and the ECS architecture.

  This release, on top of the changes below, adds the amethyst_tiles crate, which provides utilities that makes handling and drawing stuff in tiles a lot easier! 🎉

### Hot Reloading (TODO)

I just posted a progress update of hot reloading in #rustlang  that @AbbeyGamesNL's Bas and I are working on. Go check it out!

<https://twitter.com/wodannson/status/1168671379392258049>
<https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/cywwtv/progress_on_hot_reloading_experimentation_in_rust>

@Wodann:
Progress of my experimentation with hot reloading in Rust. The video shows:

- Catching and logging of errors (e.g. type mismatch)
- Hot reloading of a shared library's symbols (used for reflection)
- Hot reloading of method logic
- Runtime type / method reflection
- Runtime invokable methods

The error message still reads "Found: ?", but obviously this will change to "Found: f32" in the future.

I just open sourced our #rustlang hot reloading experimentation. It's a first step towards a scripting language focused on quick iteration times for #gamedev. Feel free to study and use the code under the MIT or Apache licenses. <https://github.com/mun-lang/runtime> @rust_gamedev @rustlang

  Split my code into main and libs (one for now), also found out that if "debug" build is too slow to run and "release" build is too slow to compile, one can set required opt level and set incremental build on, which massively improves the workflow.

- [@pincfloit](https://twitter.com/pincfloit): Here's a tiny text-based game done with @rustlang. It's still on development so expect plenty of bugs and new features to come. But it's been so fun to code and I'm learning a lot

  (**TODO**: add this game to games-in-rust list)

  > Find food, water and resources to live as long as possible.
  >
  > This is a command line interface game. This means it will open a terminal window and you need to type stuff to play. Very old school :)
  >
  > This game is under development and it's made with Rust. It's kind of a demake of a  game I had previosuly made with JavaScript, that you can play here. The reason I started working on this was to learn Rust, but I like it so much that it might become the official version of Live and end up having more features.

- [@phaazon]: [luminance] 0.33

  adds a new yet important feature that was missing (!!): geometry instancing

  This is just a small post to announce luminance got its third chapter released today, and it’s about loading a 3D object and rendering it with an omnidirectional light! It’s a sequel to the second chapter that you should read too, but this is not necessary to understand the concepts of this new chapter.

  <https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs/wiki>

  [You can find the wiki page here.](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs/wiki/Wavefront-.obj-loader)

  As always, feel free to provide feedback about the wiki and your experience with luminance. Keep the vibes!

- [@phaazon] My small yet funny spline editor is building up, using luminance and splines!

  <https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/d7tjyj/spline10> (**TODO**: extract some notes from the Reddit announcement)

  Written with heart with [luminance], [splines].

  Continuation of my spline editor. I added Bézier splines lately to the splines crate and I’m currently debugging them by adding support for editing tangents in the editor. Lots of fun!

  The base for falling cubes have been implemented! - <https://twitter.com/MrVallentin/status/1170164060542918656>

  - This isn't necessarily #gamedev, but I'm really happy
    with the crisp text #rendering I finally finished implementing.

    The font glyphs are dynamically rendered to a bitmap as needed (as shown below, scaled up). Supporting multiple fonts and dynamically updating the texture as needed.

    Font loading is powered by #RustType (#Rust TrueType crate).

    <https://twitter.com/MrVallentin/status/1170515003113451520>

  - Today it's 2 months ago since I started working on my #voxel engine.

    It's written in Rust, and the main focus is on performance.
    Every day the amount of voxels increase or the #generation gets faster.

    <https://twitter.com/MrVallentin/status/1174493952894033920>

  - Finally implemented saving and loading.
    Now it's way more fun to spend time building stuff, since it gets saved!

    <https://twitter.com/MrVallentin/status/1176996637681623042>

  - I could watch this all day. Around 1800 chunks or 60M cubes generated in the blink of an eye!

- [@Mistodon](https://twitter.com/Mistodon):
  Doing something a little different today. Namely, getting my entire game to render in the terminal :0

  Got to be one of the most obscure benefits of writing your own engine

- ([@aclysma]): More progress on the editor prototype (emphasis on prototype! 😀), added rotation/scaling.

- ([@aclysma]): New crate: imgui-inspect for drawing structs via imgui

  I needed a property editor for a game framework I've been working on. The approach I took seemed like it might be useful to others so I broke it out into its own crate.

  **TODO**: _this position is most likely closed by now, but it's still interesting that rendy has been choosen as a technology. Should it be included into the newsletter? hmm_

- blend - A parser and runtime for Blender's .blend files

  <https://github.com/lukebitts/blend>
  <https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/d70lu6/blend_a_parser_and_runtime_for_blenders_blend>

  You can use it to read (almost) everything inside the file, from mesh data, materials, cameras and animations to user preferences, window locations and render settings.

  This is the product of much yak shaving as I'm actually working on a game and I decided to use Blender as a visual editor. Hopefully this is useful to someone else!
