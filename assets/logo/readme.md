# Logo

The vectorized logo is a re-drawn version based on
[@shmutalov](https://github.com/shmutalov)'s [original, rasterized version](https://github.com/rust-gamedev/wg/issues/4).

It incorporates the official [rust-logo-gear-only.svg](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-artwork/blob/master/logo/rust-logo-gear-only.svg).

## Exporting

The various exported PNG's in [static](../static/) can be found in [rust-gamedev-logo-raw.svg](./rust-gamedev-logo-raw.svg) as individual (Inkscape) pages.

After exporting be sure to run `svgo` on the exported SVG and `optipng` on the exported PNGs.
