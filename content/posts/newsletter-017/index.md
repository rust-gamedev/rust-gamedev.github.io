Welcome to the 17th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea has a Discord!][wor-discord]

![New Way of Rhea assets](way-of-rhea.gif)
_Updated visuals for interactive items._

[Way of Rhea][wor-website] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world
where you can only interact with objects that match your current color. The game
is being developed in a custom built Rust game engine and hot swappable
scripting language.

This month's updates:

- More progress has been made on the hub world! The game is no longer fully
  linear.
- All interactive elements are getting a visual update, pictured above.
- The devs have created [a Discord server][wor-discord] where you can hang out,
  stay up to date on the latest developments, and if you're interested, chat
  about the implementation (see the `#tech` channel.)

## Learning Material Updates

### [Undergrad Thesis on game scripting for Legion]

In december 2020, [@pablodiegoss] and [@rodrigocam] presented their undergrad
thesis where they created a proof-of-concept scripting system for the Legion ECS
, called [Legion Script]. Legion is being currently integrated into the
[Amethyst Game Engine], and this contribution might be included in future
 releases.

With [Legion Script], it is possible to declare, write and read components into
Legion using Python scripts. However, this project exports an API which can be
evolved for other languages and interpreters.

Since then, both developers have been sharing their work and receiving feedbacks
for the project while planning the next steps for the code, which is available
at [GitHub].
