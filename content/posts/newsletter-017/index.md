Welcome to the 17th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea has a Discord!][wor-discord]

![New Way of Rhea assets](way-of-rhea.gif)
_Updated visuals for interactive items._

[Way of Rhea][wor-website] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world
where you can only interact with objects that match your current color. The game
is being developed in a custom built Rust game engine and hot swappable
scripting language.

This month's updates:

- More progress has been made on the hub world! The game is no longer fully
  linear.
- All interactive elements are getting a visual update, pictured above.
- The devs have created [a Discord server][wor-discord] where you can hang out,
  stay up to date on the latest developments, and if you're interested, chat
  about the implementation (see the `#tech` channel.)

### [15-minute Santa][15m-santa]

![15-minute Santa](santa.png)

In [15-minute Santa][15m-santa], you deliver presents around a city,
occasionally stopping at a restaurant to refuel -- biking uphill in the snow
isn't easy! The game uses real data from OpenStreetMap and local GIS sources to
know where shops, single-family homes, and apartments are located. In places
where zoning rules keep people separated from food, Santa will have a hard
time.

15-minute Santa was created by the [A/B Street](abstreet) team as an experiment
to see how quickly we could build a simple arcade game that gets people
thinking about how their city is designed. [The code](santa-code) doesn't make
use of an entity-component system or an existing engine, and animation and
particle effects don't use a custom shader. The game runs natively on Linux,
Mac, and Windows, and on web browsers. There are instructions for modding the
game and adding your own city!

A/B Street updates will return next month. In the meantime, please comment on
the [2021 roadmap](abstreet-roadmap).

### [Egregoria]

![Egregoria farm and flour factory at night](egregoria.jpg)

[Egregoria]'s objective is to become a granular society simulation,
filled with fully autonomous agents interacting with their world in real time.
The city should evolve by itself and form interesting patterns.

The [7th devlog][egregoria-blog-post] was published. Celebrating the first
anniversary of the project! Updates include:

- A summary of Egregoria's progress and ambition.
- Music and sounds.
- Basic economy design.
- A specialized gridlock detection algorithm.

### [Weegames][weegames-itch]

![Four Weegames minigames](weegames.jpg)

[Weegames][weegames-itch] is a fast-paced minigame collection.

The game now has a [web demo][weegames-itch] ([source][weegames-demo-source])
made with macroquad.
Sound was recently added to the demo using the quad-snd library.

### [A Zombie Shooter Game][a-zombie-shooter-game]

[![Demo](a-zombie-shooter-game-demo.gif)][a-zombie-shooter-game-youtube]
_Demo on YouTube_

[A Zombie Shooter Game][a-zombie-shooter-game] is a work-in-progress multiplayer top-down shooter. Actually, it's a Rust port of my old Java game its goal was very simple - to shoot zombies chasing after you. The game has several advantages, like high-quality bullet ballistics and geocentric camera rotation relative to the player.

This month's updates:

- Added dummy AI.
- Projectiles (shooting) synchronization over network.
- Collision detection.

## Learning Material Updates

### [How to Revive a Dead Rust Project][rustfest-talk]

[![RustFest Sketchnote](how-to-revive-a-dead-rust-project.jpg)][rustfest-talk]

At [RustFest Global 2020], [@micah_tigley] and [@carlosupina] talked about their
experiences collaborating together to revive the [space_shooter_rs] project through
effective planning, refactoring, and documentation. The video was recently
[released on YouTube][talk-tweet] in December!

Since then, both developers have been working away on improving the
game. Some updates include:

- [Adding debug lines for hitboxes][debug-lines]
- [Creating configurations files to store player variables][player-config]

### [Building Pikachu Volleyball][pikachu-video]

[![YouTube Preview: Video thumbnail with a crab and text](pikachu0.png)][pikachu-video]
_Click to [watch the video on YouTube][pikachu-video]_

[Building Pikachu Volleyball][pikachu-video] by [@danlogs] is the latest episode
of a video series inspired by Shing Lyu's book [Practical Rust Projects][amazon-book].
Here, [@danlogs] re-creates the Pikachu spin-off game from 1997
by Satoshi Takenouchi - Pikachu Volleyball.

Apart from being a good way for aspiring game developers to start
understanding the gist of game dev with Rust, this video also displays some of
the language's hardest topics (i.e. ownership, lifetimes, modules, etc.)
in a real-world application.

[The source code is available here.][pikachu-src]

### [starframe]

![Current state of starframe graphics and physics](starframe.gif)

[starframe] by [@moletrooper] is a work-in-progress game engine
for physics-y sidescrolling 2D games. This month, a new, more versatile
constraint solver was used to add friction and basic joints. Collision
detection accuracy and overall stability were also improved.

### [rpt]: Rust Path Tracer

![demo renders](rpt-collage.jpg)
_Sample images rendered by path tracing._

[rpt] by [@ekzhang] is a physically based, CPU-only rendering engine written in
Rust. It uses path tracing to generate realistic images of 3D scenes.

There's a lot of features, including kd-tree mesh acceleration, physical
material properties (microfacet BSDF with multiple importance sampling), HDRI
environment maps, OBJ/MTL/STL files, depth of field, and particle physics
simulation.

It's also parallelized with [rayon] and available as a library on [crates.io].
The entire source code, including code for the above examples and more, is very
short (~3K SLOC). Future directions include extending the renderer with
bidirectional path tracing and other features.
