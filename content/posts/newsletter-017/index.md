Welcome to the 17th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea has a Discord!][wor-discord]

![New Way of Rhea assets](way-of-rhea.gif)
_Updated visuals for interactive items._

[Way of Rhea][wor-website] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world
where you can only interact with objects that match your current color. The game
is being developed in a custom built Rust game engine and hot swappable
scripting language.

This month's updates:

- More progress has been made on the hub world! The game is no longer fully
  linear.
- All interactive elements are getting a visual update, pictured above.
- The devs have created [a Discord server][wor-discord] where you can hang out,
  stay up to date on the latest developments, and if you're interested, chat
  about the implementation (see the `#tech` channel.)

## Learning Material Updates

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [rpt: a rust path tracer](https://github.com/ekzhang/rpt/)

![demo renders](rpt-collage.jpg)
_Sample images rendered by path tracing._

[rpt] by [@ekzhang] is a physically based, CPU-only rendering engine written in
Rust. It uses path tracing to generate realistic images of 3D scenes.

There's a lot of features, including kd-tree mesh acceleration, physical
material properties (microfacet BSDF with multiple importance sampling), HDRI
environment maps, OBJ/MTL/STL files, depth of field, and particle physics
simulation.

It's also parallelized with [rayon] and available as a library on [crates.io].
The entire source code, including code for the above examples and more, is very
short (~3K SLOC). Future directions include extending the renderer with
bidirectional path tracing and other features.
