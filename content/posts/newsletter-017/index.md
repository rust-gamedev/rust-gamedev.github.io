Welcome to the 17th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea has a Discord!][wor-discord]

![New Way of Rhea assets](way-of-rhea.gif)
_Updated visuals for interactive items._

[Way of Rhea][wor-website] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world
where you can only interact with objects that match your current color. The game
is being developed in a custom built Rust game engine and hot swappable
scripting language.

This month's updates:

- More progress has been made on the hub world! The game is no longer fully
  linear.
- All interactive elements are getting a visual update, pictured above.
- The devs have created [a Discord server][wor-discord] where you can hang out,
  stay up to date on the latest developments, and if you're interested, chat
  about the implementation (see the `#tech` channel.)

### doukutsu-rs

![d-rs grasstown screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/U7cwKY2.png)

[doukutsu-rs][drs-repo] is a remake of [Cave Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Story)
engine, meant to be a drop-in replacement for the original game executable
(both freeware and commercial version), focused on being a portable modding
tool (most Cave Story mods patch the executable directly, including machine
code editing/assembly hacks) and adding various visual and gameplay-related
enhancements.

Built mainly using modified [ggez](https://ggez.rs/) crate, runs on desktop
and Android.

Changes done during last month:

- [Made an Android port with full touchscreen controls.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kh79r1/made_my_rust_remake_of_cave_story_engine_run_on/)
- Started work on Lua API, meant for building custom stuff on top of the
  engine.
- Started work on pushing our changes upstream and moving back to mainline
  versions of crates.
- Improvements to the Organya player (a simple synthetiser that plays the
  in-game music using a set of 100 waves and 6 drum samples).
- Added a bunch of missing NPCs, bosses and other stuff.
- Redesigned the way how game loop works, in preparation for adding networked
  multiplayer support.
- Countless bug fixes.
