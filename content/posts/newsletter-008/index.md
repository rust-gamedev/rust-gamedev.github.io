Welcome to the eighth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

## Library & Tooling Updates

### gfx-rs and wgpu news

[gfx-hal-0.5](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/) was released :tada: 
Improvements done in March:
  - Debug markers. Users are now able to debug-annotate parts of the rendered frame, so that inspecting it in a GPU debugger is more enjoyable.
  - The generic range parameters are removed in favor of simple structs. This is a move towards simpler low-level API.
  - Physical device features for NDC Y-flip and sampler mirror clamp are added
  - Physical device performance hints are introduced. The first hint is for "base vertex/instance" support.
  - `SmallVec` is removed from the API, it's reshaped to avoid any heap allocations. Previously, it had to touch the heap on multiple descriptor sets or command buffers.
  - DX12 got true support for read-only storage bindings. This is one of the opt-in derivations from Vulkan that allow to better map users logic to non-Vulkan backends, also used by WebGPU.
  - Last but not the least, @zicklag [has been fighting](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/pull/3151) with the OpenGL backend to align its API with the rest of the crowd, armed with [surfman](https://github.com/pcwalton/surfman). The fight is reading conclusion, and we are crossing fingers to add OpenGL support to `wgpu-rs` as it lands.

[wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) and [wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) changes in March:
  - @grovesNL reached an epic milestone in the Web target by showing the [first triangle](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/pull/193#issuecomment-599156540). Users will soon be able to seamlessly target the web with their existing `wgpu-rs` applications :rocket:
  - `wgpu-types` crate is created to share types between the Web target and the native one.
  - @lachlansneff improved the _async_ story quite a bit, we also converted more methods to be asynchronous.
  - Debug labels support.
  - Id management story for browsers with a GPU process has been completely redesigned and now working well.
  - All the objects are properly destroyed and GPU tracked if needed.
  - Ability to provide a `Surface` so that the selected adapter can present to it.
  - New "mailbox" present mode.

Satellite projects:
  - [naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga) - the new in-house shader translator has reached the milestone of successfully loading a WGSL [boids example](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga/blob/thda1f6a47b06c89abb1dff70326c076f1088964a3/test-data/boids.wgsl) and generating a valid Metal source for it :tada:
  - [metal-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/metal-rs/) has got a lot of contribution by @adamnemecek. Indirect command encoding is particularly exciting!
  - [gfx-extras](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-extras) is a new library that is forked from rendy-memory/descriptor.
  - [gfx-ocean](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-ocean) was moved to gfx-rs organization and updated to gfx-hal-0.5.
  - [gfx-portability](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability) was also updated.

### [Quest Engine Part 2: Deploying a Rust App On Android][quest-part-2]

![Oculus Quest](./quest.jpg)

The [second part][quest-part-2] of Nikita Krupitskas'
[blog series][quest-part-1] on developing a game engine for the Oculus Quest
has been posted.

This part of the series describes how a simple Rust project can be built
for Android - useful even if you're not targeting the Oculus hardware!

### [const-tweaker]

![const-tweaker UI](./const-tweaker.gif)

Thomas Versteeg has released a new crate called `const-tweaker`, which provides
a web UI that can be used to tweak `const` variables in a running application.
This can be used as a simpler alternative to embedded scripting languages or
hot-reloading in your games.

### [assets_manager]

a1phyr has created a crate called `assets_manager`, which provides a convienient way
to load and cache external resources. It abstracts over the filesystem logic, and
provides a variety of built-in loaders for common Serde formats (e.g. TOML, JSON).
Hot-reloading support is also planned in the future.
