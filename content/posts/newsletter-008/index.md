Welcome to the eighth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Spreading the Word

If you're working on a project that heavily relies on some engine/framework,
consider informing its authors about your work:
as the community is growing it happens more and more that
frameworks/engines authors just don't know about users of their libs
(this note was requested by Icefox in relation to [GGEZ projects][ggez-projects]).

### For The Quest

![For The Quest screenshot](forthequest.jpg)

For The Quest is the working title for a game in early development by
[@seratonik][]. Written entirely in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly,
For The Quest is destined to become a MMORPG set in a post-apocalyptic
Earth where your goal is to band together into like-minded factions to
not only survive in this new world, but to unearth the cause of humanity's
downfall.

For The Quest is currently undergoing engine development with a focus on
running smoothly in modern browsers using WebGL 2.0 before moving onto
native desktop ports.

New developments in March:

- Collision and Activation-Based Triggerable Entities (Able to load new areas)
- New overworld "sky light" directional lighting shaders in addition to
  omni-directional point lighting for underground areas
- New Ice Cavern models and textures, establishing a hybrid pixel-art in 3D
  style - mapping tool has been expanded to allow for rotating "tiles" to
  build extensive environments in a simple text format for rapid prototyping
- Specular maps added to the engine and world for that extra shine
- Started refactoring the rendering pipeline to allow for screen-space effects
  such as reflections and ambient occlusion

### gfx-rs and wgpu news

![Deeper game](deeper.png)

^ _[deeper] uses wgpu for rendering_

[gfx-hal-0.5](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/) was released!
Improvements done in March:

- Debug markers.
  Users are now able to debug-annotate parts of the rendered frame,
  so that inspecting it in a GPU debugger is more enjoyable.
- The generic range parameters are removed in favor of simple structs.
  This is a move towards simpler low-level API.
- Physical device features for NDC Y-flip and sampler mirror clamp are added.
- Physical device performance hints are introduced.
  The first hint is for "base vertex/instance" support.
- `SmallVec` is removed from the API, it's reshaped
  to avoid any heap allocations.
  Previously, it had to touch the heap on multiple descriptor sets
  or command buffers.
- DX12 got true support for read-only storage bindings.
  This is one of the opt-in derivations from Vulkan that allow to better map
  users logic to non-Vulkan backends, also used by WebGPU.
- Last but not the least, @zicklag
  [has been fighting](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/pull/3151)
  with the OpenGL backend to align its API with the rest of the crowd,
  armed with [surfman](https://github.com/pcwalton/surfman).
  The fight is reading conclusion, and we are crossing fingers
  to add OpenGL support to `wgpu-rs` as it lands.

[wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) and
[wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) changes in March:

- @grovesNL reached an epic milestone in the Web target
  by showing the [first triangle][wgpu-web-triangle].
  Users will soon be able to seamlessly target the web
  with their existing `wgpu-rs` applications. 🚀
- `wgpu-types` crate is created to share types between the Web target
  and the native one.
- @lachlansneff improved the _async_ story quite a bit,
  we also converted more methods to be asynchronous.
- Debug labels support.
- Id management story for browsers with a GPU process
  has been completely redesigned and now working well.
- All the objects are properly destroyed and GPU tracked if needed.
- Ability to provide a `Surface` so that the selected adapter can present to it.
- New "mailbox" present mode.

Satellite projects:

- [naga] - the new in-house shader translator has reached the milestone
  of successfully loading a WGSL [boids example]
  and generating a valid Metal source for it. 🎉
- [metal-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/metal-rs)
  has got a lot of contribution by @adamnemecek.
  Indirect command encoding is particularly exciting!
- [gfx-extras](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-extras) is
  a new library that is forked from rendy-memory/descriptor.
- [gfx-ocean](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-ocean) was moved
  to gfx-rs organization and updated to gfx-hal-0.5.
- [gfx-portability](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability) was also updated.

- [Ametyst 0.15.0 was released][amethyst_release]:

  - Better panic messages on `stable` Rust.
  - Support for setting log levels from configuration.
  - Text field rendering corrections.
  - Target multiple overlapping UI entities with events.

- [`specs`] is the underlying ECS that powers Amethyst but there's an
[ongoing prospect][amethyst_legion_rfc] of moving to [`legion`].
  [@csherratt] wrote an [excellent post][amethyst_specs_legion] comparing both
  libraries. Also an [in-depth discussion][amethyst_ecs_discussion] about
archetypal and grouped ECS design took place on the forum.

- [Atelier][amethyst_atelier] is an asset management and processing
  framework for games.
  Coupled with [`legion`], [@aclysma] and [@kabergstrom] built an
  [editor prototype][amethyst_editor_prototype] demonstrating the following
capabilities:

  - Prefab loading, saving, and hot-reloading
  - Entity creation / deletion
  - Component addition / removal
  - Undo and Redo

Check out the [demo video][amethyst_editor_youtube] and
[forum discussion][amethyst_editor_forum].

- There is an [ongoing effort to bring WASM support to Amethyst][amethyst_wasm_effort].
  Check out the [contribution guide][amethyst_wasm_contribution_guide]
and [project board][amethyst_wasm_project_board] for current status.

- [@ToferC] reviewed their experience using Amethyst to build a space combat game,
  [Paladin][amethyst_review_paladin]. Check out the
  [review on youtube][amethyst_review_youtube].

### [Rectangle Pack][rectangle-pack-homepage] v0.1.5

`Rectangle Pack` is a Rust crate focused on rectangle packing: Laying out any smaller
number of rectangles inside any number of larger rectangles. The developer's use
for the library is in packing textures from texture atlases on the GPU, although
the library does not have any concept of texture, and can be used in any
context where rectangle packing may be needed.

Version 0.1.5 adds implementation for error handling for RectanglePackError.

A getting started guide is available on the [project's homepage][rectangle-pack-homepage].
Full documentation is available at the [rectangle-pack docs.rs section][rectangle-pack-docs].

Just an interesting Rust gamedev link from the past. :)

![Robo Instructus logo](robo-logo.jpeg)

On 2019.07.16 a puzzle game ["Robo Instructus"][robo-site] by [Alex Butler][bigabgames]
was released after two years of development:
[Steam][robo-steam]/[itch.io][robo-itch] (demo is available).

> Salvage Engineer, you have a new assignment on a distant world...
>
> Robo Instructus is a puzzle game in which players manoeuvre a robot
> by issuing instructions via a simple programming language.
> As players progress through the game they unlock new functions
> to overcome new puzzles, each of which can be solved in multiple ways.
> The more you master the robot, the more elegant and powerful
> your solutions will be.
>
> Take the role of a Salvage Engineer sent across space.
> Use wits and tenacity to uncover the secrets of this isolated, frozen world.

[![gameplay screenshot with jumping robot](robo-screenshot.jpg)][robo-video]

Check out the [release trailer][robo-video].

The game is written using gfx-rs (pre-ll), winit, and opengl.
You can read more about its development in the [**awesome devlog**][robo-log]
that has lots of cool posts like
