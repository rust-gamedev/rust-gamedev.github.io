Welcome to the 14th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Crevice]

[Crevice] is a library that helps define GLSL-compatible (std140) structs for
use in uniform and storage buffers. It uses new `const fn` capabilities
stabilized in [Rust 1.46.0] to align types with explicitly zeroed padding.

Crevice depends heavily on [mint] to support almost any Rust math library. It
also contains helpers for safely sizing and writing buffers, making dynamic
buffer layout a breeze.

```rust
#[derive(AsStd140)]
struct MainUniform {
    orientation: mint::ColumnMatrix3<f32>,
    position: mint::Vector3<f32>,
    scale: f32,
}

let value = MainUniform {
    orientation: cgmath::Matrix3::identity().into(),
    position: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].into(),
    scale: 4.0,
};

upload_data_to_gpu(value.as_std140().as_bytes());
```

### [Thunderdome]

[Thunderdome] is a ~gladitorial~ generational arena library inspired by
[generational-arena], [slotmap], and [slab]. It provides constant time
insertion, lookup, and removal via small (8 byte) keys that stay 8 bytes when
wrapped in `Option<T>`.

Data structures like Thunderdome's `Arena` store values and return keys that can
be later used to access those values. These keys are stable across removals and
have a generation counter to solve the [ABA Problem].

```rust
let mut arena = Arena::new();

let foo = arena.insert("Foo");
let bar = arena.insert("Bar");

assert_eq!(arena[foo], "Foo");
assert_eq!(arena[bar], "Bar");

arena[bar] = "Replaced";
assert_eq!(arena[bar], "Replaced");

let foo_value = arena.remove(foo);
assert_eq!(foo_value, Some("Foo"));

// The slot previously used by foo will be reused for baz.
let baz = arena.insert("Baz");
assert_eq!(arena[baz], "Baz");

// foo is no longer a valid key.
assert_eq!(arena.get(foo), None);
```
