### [Nox Futura (Rust Edition)][noxfutura]

![Gameplay screenshots](noxfutura.jpeg)

[Nox Futura][noxfutura] by [@blackfuture]
is an open-source long-term passion project,
a Dwarf-Fortress and RimWorld inspired base building game.

Some of the [recent updates][noxfutura-reddit]:

- The WGPU-based rendered is undergoing a major restructure.
- The game was updated to Legion 0.3 - it required rewriting a lot of code,
  but the new syntax sugar is a joy to use, and the backend is even faster now.
- The Greedy Voxel algorithm was significantly improved.
- OBJ models are now supported - useful for things like tree/vegetation geometry,
  which can now use a stylized low-poly graphic without the added weight
  of a bunch of cubes.
- Palette-based rendering - the output system is now constrained
  to a 256 color palette, mostly to play with stylized 3D rendering.
- New format for data files that combines multiple RON objects in one place.

### Oh no, Lava!

![shooting water into lava](ohnolava_troligtvis.gif)

"Oh no, Lava!" by [@captainfleppo] is the working title
of a platforming game which take inspiration
from an old iOS game created back in 2014. The game is running with [Bevy][bevy]
as its core. The gameplay isn't there yet, but you as a player need to jump on
furnitures, collect coins and fight lava/fire based enemies with your water gun.

### [BUGOUT]

![Play Go against AI and friends on the web](BUGOUT.jpg)
_Playing KataGo AI in 9x9_

[BUGOUT] is a web application which allows you to play Go/Baduk/Weiqi
against a leading AI ([KataGo]).
It provides a multiplayer mode so that you can play other humans,
either by joining a public queue or sharing a private URL to your friend.

The user interface is lifted from [Sabaki].

The initial installation's AI is powered by an energy-efficient
[dev board][nv-devboard].

BUGOUT is marching actively toward production, at which point the
team will publish the website address and invite users.
The author anticipates being finished with the production release
prior to Jan 1, 2021.

## Learning Material Updates

### [OpenGL Preprocessor for Rust]

With the full power of Cargo build scripts and [Tera], you can create an advanced
GLSL preprocessor which can generate code conditionally, in loops, and even
inherit code from other templates.

![An OpenGL preprocessor for Rust](opengl_preprocessor.png)

Writing plain GLSL code is uncomfortable, code is quite often is duplicated, libraries
aren't something natural for GLSL (means you can't out of the box do #include "library.glsl").
The last point is especially problematic if some constants actually originate in
your game logic (like the number of player types). Updating these values manually
in your shader code is repetitive and prone to both error and simple forgetfulness.
It's really helpful to build some kind of preprocessor for your GLSL code,
which can include other files, so you can organize your code into manageable chunks.
With the power of [Tera], it's now easy to accomplish.
Because Rust is also often used for web projects, which need a lot of templated
web-pages preprocessing, we can borrow such technology for our needs,
combine it with cargo build scripts and create a compile-time preprocessing tool.

### Rust, Gamedev, ECS, and Bevy

![Bevy hello world code snippet and two game screenshots, one displaying two
blue spheres in a grey canvas and another one displaying a gameboy colored tile
game](ecs-bevy-tutorial.png)

[@hugopeixoto] released a couple of blog posts on ECS and Bevy,
including a tutorial on how to get started.

- The [first part][hugopeixoto-p1] gives us an in depth overview of what ECS.
  It starts with pseudocode for an object oriented approach
  and goes through several iterations until we get to the ECS paradigm.

- The [second part][hugopeixoto-p2] is a tutorial on how to use [bevy],
  a data driven game engine built in Rust.
  It goes over the basic features of the engine,
  using the example presented in the first part.

## Library & Tooling Updates

<!-- TODO! -->

### [Bracket-Lib]

[bracket-lib] (previously `rltk_rs`) by [@blackfuture]
is a Rust implementation of [C++ Roguelike Toolkit][rltk-cpp].

Bracket-lib is going through a stability pass, focusing on freezing the API.
It will be featured in the author's upcoming book:
*Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play*.
The book should be going into early access/beta in time for the next newsletter.

### [Thunderdome]

[Thunderdome] is a ~~gladitorial~~ generational arena library inspired by
[generational-arena], [slotmap], and [slab]. It provides constant time
insertion, lookup, and removal via small (8 byte) keys that stay 8 bytes when
wrapped in `Option<T>`.

Data structures like Thunderdome's `Arena` store values and return keys that can
be later used to access those values. These keys are stable across removals and
have a generation counter to solve the [ABA Problem].

```rust
let mut arena = Arena::new();

let foo = arena.insert("Foo");
let bar = arena.insert("Bar");

assert_eq!(arena[foo], "Foo");
assert_eq!(arena[bar], "Bar");

arena[bar] = "Replaced";
assert_eq!(arena[bar], "Replaced");

let foo_value = arena.remove(foo);
assert_eq!(foo_value, Some("Foo"));

// The slot previously used by foo will be reused for baz.
let baz = arena.insert("Baz");
assert_eq!(arena[baz], "Baz");

// foo is no longer a valid key.
assert_eq!(arena.get(foo), None);
```

### [audir]

[audir] is a low level audio library supporting Windows (WASAPI), Linux (Pulse)
and Android (OpenSLES & AAudio).

It aims at provide a minimal and mostly unsafe but feature-rich API on top of
common audio backends with focus on gaming applications. The initial release
version 0.1.0 provides basic recording and playback support for all available
backends, including a small music player example!

Currently looking into coupling with [dasp] for dsp audio graphs to provide
a higher level entry point.

### [Crevice]

[Crevice] is a library that helps define GLSL-compatible (std140) structs for
use in uniform and storage buffers. It uses new `const fn` capabilities
stabilized in [Rust 1.46.0] to align types with explicitly zeroed padding.

Crevice depends heavily on [mint] to support almost any Rust math library. It
also contains helpers for safely sizing and writing buffers, making dynamic
buffer layout a breeze.

```rust
#[derive(AsStd140)]
struct MainUniform {
    orientation: mint::ColumnMatrix3<f32>,
    position: mint::Vector3<f32>,
    scale: f32,
}

let value = MainUniform {
    orientation: cgmath::Matrix3::identity().into(),
    position: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].into(),
    scale: 4.0,
};

upload_data_to_gpu(value.as_std140().as_bytes());
```

### [FemtoVG]

![femtovg](femtovg.png)

[FemtoVG] is a 2D canvas API in Rust, based on [nanovg].

Currently, FemtoVG uses OpenGL as a rendering backend. A Metal backend is 95%
done, and a wgpu backend is on the roadmap. The project is definitely looking
for contributors.

Unlike NanoVG, FemtoVG has full text-shaping support thanks to harfbuzz.

FemtoVG, just like the original NanoVG, is based on the _stencil-then-cover_
approach presented in [GPU-accelerated Path Rendering][gpupathrender.pdf].

### [gfx-rs] and [gfx-portability]

![gfx-rs logo](gfx-logo.png)

[gfx-portability] is a Vulkan portability implementation based on [gfx-rs].
It's basically a drop-in implementation of Vulkan on top of Metal and D3D12,
useful on platforms that don't have native Vulkan support, or buggy drivers.

It released version [0.8.1](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability/releases/tag/0.8.1)
with official support for the new [KHR portability extension][khr-portability],
as well as a few other extensions, plus a number of correctness fixes.

gfx-rs team asks Rust users of Vulkano, Ash, and other Vulkan-only wrappers to try
out the gfx-portability as a solution on macOS and relevant Windows 10 platforms.

In [gfx-rs] itself, the DX12 backend, and the descriptor indexing feature support
got improved. There has been a push to get DX11 backend in a solid shape,
and it can now run [vange-rs] pretty well 🎉.

### [Riddle]

[Riddle] is a Rust media library in the vein of SDL,
building as far as possible on the most active/standard Rust libraries
(winit, wgpu, image, etc). Riddle is deliberately not an engine, or a framework.
It is a library devoted to exposing media related features in a unified way while
avoiding prescribing program structure. It provides abstractions over windowing,
input, audio, image loading/manipulation and provides a basic wgpu based 2D
renderer.
The [docs][riddle-docs] contain runnable examples for most methods and types.

The goal is to provide a stable foundation, resillient to developments in the Rust
gamedev ecosystem, on which games, custom engines, and other media applications can
be built.

### Tetra

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA and Raylib. This month,
version [0.5][tetra-05] was released, featuring:

- Cargo feature flags, allowing you to remove unused functionality and
  shrink your build
- Relative mouse events and infinite mouse movement (allowing for FPS-style
  control schemes)
- Extra methods for getting and setting the state of a playing sound

For full details and a list of breaking changes, see the [changelog][tetra-changelog].

Additionally, this month [puppetmaster] released [tetrapack], a set of useful
extensions for Tetra. This includes:
