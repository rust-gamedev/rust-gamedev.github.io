Welcome to the 14th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [audir]

`audir` is a low level audio library supporting Windows (WASAPI), Linux (Pulse) and Android (OpenSLES & AAudio).

It aims at provide a minimal and mostly unsafe but feature-rich API on top of common audio backends with focus on gaming applications.
The initial release version `0.1.0` provides basic recording and playback support for all available backends, including a small music player example!

Currently looking into coupling with [dasp] for dsp audio graphs to provide a higher level entry point.
