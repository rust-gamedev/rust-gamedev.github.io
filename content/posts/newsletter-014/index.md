Welcome to the 14th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Is it easy to draw a line?][Lines]

![hexagonal strategy map with region borders](lines_hexstrat.jpeg)
_Example of result chains._

A small note by [@VladZhukov0] about drawing lines and chains
with signed distance fields.
The resulted lines are nice looking on edges and have rounded corners.
Chains for this article assumed to be opaque.

Check out the [online demo](https://pum-purum-pum-pum.github.io/lines/)
and its [source code](https://github.com/pum-purum-pum-pum/Lines).
