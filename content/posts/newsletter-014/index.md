Welcome to the 14th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea]

[![Way of Rhea logo](way-of-rhea-header.jpg)][Way of Rhea]

[Way of Rhea] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world where you can
only interact with items that match your current color.
Changes since the last update:

- The circuit level has been reworked:
  it's now split into three different levels
  and the puzzles are better tutorialized, and there are more of them.
- A tiny amount of screen shake was added to the game.
- Work has begun on a couple of new levels for the ice biome:

  In this biome, you have to learn to predict the behavior of these little
  crabs to solve the puzzles:
