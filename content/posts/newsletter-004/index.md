Welcome to the fourth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Le Train Dispatcher][ltd] - Route Trains in Simulated Rail Network

![Demo of Le Train Dispatcher](ltd.gif)

Le Train Dispatcher ([itch.io][ltd], [Patreon][ltd-patreon])
allows you to route trains in a fully simulated rail network.
Particular care has been taken on the realistic management of light signals
(block systems, switch protection), train physics and curve tracing.

The game is programmed in Rust and the main crates used are: ggez, imgui and serde.

This first version is fully playable, but if you want to comment,
bring your ideas or contribute to the development of the game,
in any way, do not hesitate to post a [message][ltd-community].

Unique characteristics:

- Realistic light signals simulation:
  Huge engineering work has been done to have realistic
  management of railway signaling.
- No collision:
  Yes it's fun to watch many trains running automatically without getting in.
  All your actions are checked: you cannot put the trains in danger.
- True physics
  - Each locomotive or wagon has its own weight,
    its driving or braking force, its coefficient of adhesion.
  - The curves are not simple circles, they are calculated with
    the same equations as those used in real road or rail networks.

### [Sulis: Basic Resource Management][sulis-resources]

![Sulis logo](sulis_logo.png)

[Sulis][sulis] is a Role-Playing Game (RPG) with turn-based, tactical combat,
deep character customization, and an engaging storyline.

This month, an article ["Basic Resource Management"][sulis-resources]
was published:

> In developing Sulis, one of the primary goals
> is easy and powerful modding capabilities.
> To that end, virtually all resources are defined via simple YAML files.
> The idea is that anyone with a text editor can create new resources
> or edit existing ones easily.
> However, this immediately brings up the question of how to manage
> all these resources within the game's state.
> In Sulis, this is handled via a central resource manager.

While Sulis is used as the primary example,
the article should apply to pretty much any game.

Also, the project (the game itself and its source code)
[was reviewed by gamefromscratch.com][sulis-video]
\[[/r/rust_gamedev](https://reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/du48iw/sulis_an_rpg_created_using_rust_gamesfromscratch)].

## Library & Tooling updates

### [Memory Arena][mem-arena]

![how entities/handles are related to each others](mem-arena.jpg)

[@kooparse] published [a post about implementing a quick memory arena][mem-arena].

> For my game, I decided to store almost every entity in a big chunk of memory
> allocated only once when the program boot.
> I am using this technique for three reasons.
> First, I want full and precise control over how memory is managed
> in the game,
> second I want better data locality in order to increase cache hits
> from the cpu,
> and finally, at runtime asking the operating system
> in order to allocate more memory is slow.

### [wgpu v0.4][wgpu-v0-4]

![some webgpu logo](webgpu.png)

[wgpu] is a library in Rust that is meant to be the go-to solution
for most graphics and compute needs.

wgpu-rs version 0.4 was released on crates.
wgpu is based on [gfx-hal-0.4] and includes
changes from the [previous blog post][old-gfx-post];

A few notable additions are:

- proper Windows 7 support;
- support for multiple clients on the same GPU server;
- slimmed-down Rendy dependencies (memory and descriptor);
- new skybox example.

Lyon has [updated examples](https://github.com/nical/lyon/pull/496)
for this version, showing how to draw vector graphics on `wgpu`.

Also, `wgpu` is now a part of Gecko code base for powering the emerging WebGPU implementation.
