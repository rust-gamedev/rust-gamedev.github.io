Welcome to the ninth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [A/B Street][abstreet]

[A/B Street][abstreet] is a game by [dabreegster] exploring how small changes to
road space and traffic signals affect the movement of drivers, cyclists,
transit users, and pedestrians. The game models Seattle as accurately as
possible using [OpenStreetMap] and other public datasets, lets the player adjust
existing infrastructure, and then does a detailed comparison to see who the
changes help and hurt.

First of all, [a standalone 2D GUI crate][abstreet-gui-release] was published
extracted from A/BStreet's GUI code.
It features fully vectorized text using [lyon] and supports lots of
widgets such as "buttons (with keybindings), checkboxes, sliders, pop-up menus,
text entry, and some data viz things".
Thanks to its simplicity (everything is a colored polygon), this crate runs on
many different architectures and even on the web via [glow].

Here's an example of what it can do:

![abstreet gui](abstreetgui.png)

Dabreegster also uploaded a recorded version of their
[rust meetup talk][abstreet-meetup-talk] about the inner working of abstreet.

> In case anybody here is interested in more city simulation in Rust,
> the talk is about half project overview and half deep dive into code.

ABstreet had some great contributor work coming in, notably from omalaspinas who
implemented an optional SEIR pandemic model into the game.

And for anyone interested in more frequent updates, the
[abstreet subreddit][abstreet-subreddit] has had weekly update posts since
September 2019.

### [Citybound]

![citybound web ui screenshot](citybound.png)

> Citybound is a city building game that uses microscopic models to vividly
> simulate the organism of a city arising from the interactions of millions
> of individuals.

It is developed by [aeplay][aeplay] and uses a homemade actor system for
everything called [kay], you can see its power on
[this impressive tech demo][kay-tech-demo].

In April, aeplay made two livestreams about conceptualizing pedestrians and
pandemic models using feedback from the chat.
You can watch the replay for the two livestreams on youtube: [here][cb-live-1]
and [here][cb-live-2].

### [Scale]

![Pedestrians](scale.png)

[Scale] is a granular society simulation by [Uriopass], with the objective
of having fully autonomous agents interacting with their world in real time.

A [devlog][scale-blog-post] was published, explaining how pedestrians were added
to the simulation, and that a new renderer based on [wgpu-rs][wgpu-rs] is in
development.
[A short video][scale-pedestrian-video] was also posted together with the post
for a more concise update.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### `gfx-rs` and `wgpu` News

![hectic screenshot: graveyard and vampires](hectic.png)

^ _[hectic-rs] - Rust/wgpu/specs re-write of hectic by [@expenses]_

wgpu-0.5 release happened! See the [changelog][wgpu-0-5].
It's based on `gfx-hal-0.5` (which was covered in the [March newsletter][gfx-march]),
uses in-house gfx-extras crates adopted from Rendy,
has many fixes and improvements, and totally changes the way passes are recorded.

`wgpu` project got restructured by only leaving `wgpu-core` and `wgpu-types`
in the main ("core logic") repository.
`wgpu-native` is moved out into a [separate one][wgpu-native].
`wgpu-remote` got fully moved into mozilla-central as "gfx/wgpu_bindings"
(this is "gfx" in a general sense, not gfx-rs in particular).

The Web target  (aka "wasm32-unknown-unknown") is now officially supported
by `wgpu-rs`! 🎉
@grovesNL wrote the announcement to [gfx-rs blog][wgpu-wasm-blog].

At the same time, @kvark was implementing support for WebGPU in Firefox
(Nightly only) with help of `wgpu`.
They published results of this milestone on [Mozilla Hacks][wgpu-in-firefox].
The combined efforts allowed all the `wgpu-rs` examples to be run
in Firefox Nightly on all platforms
(yes, even on Android, terms and conditions apply...).

Given the wide spectrum of uses for `wgpu` ("core"), it became most important
to be able to debug and reproduce visual issues, be it either the user's fault,
or wgpu implementations'.
To aid these scenarios, a new [API tracing infrastructure][wgpu-pr-tracing]
was built into the core.
It's now possible to replay user's `wgpu` workloads in a separate player
on an entirely different platform.

In gfx-rs land, @mistodon created a nice [series of tutorials][gfx-hal-tutorials]
for the gfx-hal API.

### [erupt]

![erupt logo](erupt.png)

[erupt] provides bindings to the Vulkan API.

Features include:

- Full Vulkan API coverage
- First-class support for all extensions
- High quality auto-generated function wrappers
- A diverse `utils` module
- Complete auto-generation of everything except `utils`
- Function loading
- A high level `Builder` for every struct
- Type-safe pointer chain support

Just like ash, erupt focuses on exposing good bindings to the *raw* Vulkan API
instead of providing manually written wrappers around it like Vulkano. On top
of this it tries to improve on some features where ash lacks, e.g.
auto-generation, extensions, documentation and utils.

For more information visit [docs.rs][erupt-docs] and [GitLab][erupt-gitlab].

### [miniquad]

![miniquad logo](miniquad_logo.png)

^ _`miniquad` project got a logo_

[miniquad] is a safe and cross-platform rendering library
focused on portability and low-end platforms support.

This month `miniquad`-based games got a recommended way to make sounds:
[quad-snd].
Here's a [WASM demo][quad-snd-demo] ([source][quad-snd-demo-src]).

[good-web-game] now uses [quad-snd] and can run ggez's ["sounds"][ggez-sounds]
example: [WASM demo][gwg-sounds-demo].

### [macroquad]

`macroquad` is minimalistic game framework on top of miniquad,
strongly inspired by [raylib].

This month `macroquad`'s rendering system got 2D custom cameras support:
[example source][macroquad-example-camera].
Also, `macroquad`'s UI system now support TTF fonts:
[online demo][macroquad-example-ui], [source][macroquad-example-ui-src].
