## Game Updates

### [Crate Before Attack][cratebeforeattack-site]

[![screenshot: a frog swinging on their tongue](cratebeforeattack.png)][cratebeforeattack-site]

["Crate Before Attack"][cratebeforeattack-site] by @koalefant
is a multiplayer game where frogs combat their friends
while navigating a landscape with their sticky tongue.
It is a hybrid of a realtime and turn-based game.

The game [can be played right in the browser (PC-only)][cratebeforeattack-play].

It is built for Web using [miniquad] and [tokio] crates and features:

- Swift roping (aka grappling hook);
- Diverse weapons;
- Local and online multiplayer;
- Procedural animation;
- Fun physics.

Check the [devlog][cratebeforeattack-devlog]. It has three posts atm:

- ["Inflation"](https://cratebeforeattack.com/posts/20200420-inflation)
- ["Hare Animation"](https://cratebeforeattack.com/posts/20200428-hare-animation)
- ["Rust Experiment"](https://cratebeforeattack.com/posts/20200502-rust)

Also, there're a lot of dev videos on the game's
[YouTube channel][cratebeforeattack-youtube].

### [A/B Street][abstreet]

[A/B Street][abstreet] is a game by [dabreegster] exploring how small changes to
road space and traffic signals affect the movement of drivers, cyclists,
transit users, and pedestrians. The game models Seattle as accurately as
possible using [OpenStreetMap] and other public datasets, lets the player adjust
existing infrastructure, and then does a detailed comparison to see who the
changes help and hurt.

First of all, [a standalone 2D GUI crate][abstreet-gui-release] was published
extracted from A/BStreet's GUI code.
It features fully vectorized text using [lyon] and supports lots of
widgets such as "buttons (with keybindings), checkboxes, sliders, pop-up menus,
text entry, and some data viz things".
Thanks to its simplicity (everything is a colored polygon), this crate runs on
many different architectures and even on the web via [glow].

Here's an example of what it can do:

![abstreet gui](abstreetgui.png)

Dabreegster also uploaded a recorded version of their
[rust meetup talk][abstreet-meetup-talk] about the inner working of abstreet.

> In case anybody here is interested in more city simulation in Rust,
> the talk is about half project overview and half deep dive into code.

ABstreet had some great contributor work coming in, notably from omalaspinas who
implemented an optional SEIR pandemic model into the game.

And for anyone interested in more frequent updates, the
[abstreet subreddit][abstreet-subreddit] has had weekly update posts since
September 2019.

### [Citybound]

![citybound web ui screenshot](citybound.jpeg)

> Citybound is a city building game that uses microscopic models to vividly
> simulate the organism of a city arising from the interactions of millions
> of individuals.

It is developed by [aeplay][aeplay] and uses a homemade actor system for
everything called [kay], you can see its power on
[this impressive tech demo][kay-tech-demo].

In April, aeplay made two livestreams about conceptualizing pedestrians and
pandemic models using feedback from the chat.

### [Scale]

![Pedestrians](scale.png)

[Scale] is a granular society simulation by [Uriopass], with the objective
of having fully autonomous agents interacting with their world in real time.

A [devlog][scale-blog-post] was published, explaining how pedestrians were added
to the simulation, and that a new renderer based on [wgpu-rs][wgpu-rs] is in
development.
[A short video][scale-pedestrian-video] was also posted together with the post
for a more concise update.

### For The Quest

![For The Quest screenshot](forthequest.jpg)

For The Quest is the working title for a game in early development by
[@seratonik]. Written entirely in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly,
For The Quest is destined to become a MMORPG set in a post-apocalyptic
Earth where your goal is to band together into like-minded factions to
not only survive in this new world, but to unearth the cause of humanity's
downfall.

For The Quest is currently undergoing engine development with a focus on
running smoothly in modern browsers using WebGL 2.0 before moving onto
native desktop ports.

New developments in April:

- Finished re-working and optimizing the rendering pipeline to allow for
  post-processing and other screen-space effects
- Planar reflections implemented, and work with an upgraded form of the
  specular maps to determine how reflective a surface is
- Add a flagging system so surfaces can identify their type to the
  shading system so effects can be selectively applied per pixel
- Used the new flagging system to identify water surfaces and make them
  "ripple" their reflections
- Updated the mapping/tile system to support "sunken" floor tiles, which
  allows for ponds, lakes, cliff edges, etc.
- Started work on plans for a streaming asset manager
- New desert/sand tileset models & textures (Thanks [Mishayla][mishayla]!)

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Buildings](veloren1.png)

^ _Early procedural building generation_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG
inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Cube World.

Lots of systems have been finished up in April to prepare for the launch of 0.6.
Many improvements have been made to the combat systems. Basic world and
civilization simulations have been implemented. Lots of new soundtracks have
been added. The UI is being reworked. Experimental work is being done with
migrating to wgpu, and the level of detail system is a lot closer to being
merged. Villagers have been getting a lot of love as well, making the world feel
more alive.

Here is the April changelog:

```text
- Complete rewrite of the combat system into a state machine
- Abilities like Dash and Triplestrike
- Fireball explosions
- Many new armors and weapons to find in chests
- Fleshed out "attack" animation into alpha, beta and spin type attacks
- Fleshed out range attack into charging and shooting anims for staff/bow
- Added a silhouette for players when they are occluded
- Added transparency to the player when zooming in
- Added dragging and right-click to use functionality to inventory,
  armor & hotbar slots
- Added basic world and civilisation simulation
- Added fields, crops and scarecrows, paths, bridges, procedural house generation
- Added lampposts, NPCs that spawn in towns, and simple dungeons
- Added sub-voxel noise effect
- Added waypoints next to dungeons
- Added non-uniform block heights
- Added a Level of Detail (LoD) system for terrain sprites and entities
- Villagers tools and clothing, cultists clothing
- You can start the game by pressing "enter" from the character selection menu
```

### [turbulence] and [goggles]

This month @kyren released two libraries: [turbulence] and [goggles].

> [turbulence] is the more interesting of the two, it is another attempt
> at a rust-based networking library for games.
> The main thing I think that sets it apart is that it is async
> while being totally reactor, executor, and platform agnostic.
> It is a library that just allows you to take a stream of unreliable,
> unordered packets and turn them into N independent unreliable,
> unordered or reliable, ordered streams of messages.
>
> [goggles] is probably not as interesting, but it is an aggressively
> stripped down fork of specs / shred with more of the insides exposed.
> My favorite part about specs is how easy it is to use just the parts of it
> that you actually need, but I wanted to go further.
> For me, the functionality of specs that I needed was really just
> the entity allocator, a few storage types, MaskedStorage,
> and the Join system.
> goggles is just that: the bare minimum pieces that you need
> to assemble your own ECS system, as independent as I could make them.

### `gfx-rs` and `wgpu` News

![hectic screenshot: graveyard and vampires](hectic.png)

^ _[hectic-rs] - Rust/wgpu/specs re-write of hectic by [@expenses]_

wgpu-0.5 release happened! See the [changelog][wgpu-0-5].
It's based on `gfx-hal-0.5` (which was covered in the [March newsletter][gfx-march]),
uses in-house gfx-extras crates adopted from Rendy,
has many fixes and improvements, and totally changes the way passes are recorded.

`wgpu` project got restructured by only leaving `wgpu-core` and `wgpu-types`
in the main ("core logic") repository.
`wgpu-native` is moved out into a [separate one][wgpu-native].
`wgpu-remote` got fully moved into mozilla-central as "gfx/wgpu_bindings"
(this is "gfx" in a general sense, not gfx-rs in particular).

The Web target  (aka "wasm32-unknown-unknown") is now officially supported
by `wgpu-rs`! 🎉
@grovesNL wrote the announcement to [gfx-rs blog][wgpu-wasm-blog].

At the same time, @kvark was implementing support for WebGPU in Firefox
(Nightly only) with help of `wgpu`.
They published results of this milestone on [Mozilla Hacks][wgpu-in-firefox].
The combined efforts allowed all the `wgpu-rs` examples to be run
in Firefox Nightly on all platforms
(yes, even on Android, terms and conditions apply...).

Given the wide spectrum of uses for `wgpu` ("core"), it became most important
to be able to debug and reproduce visual issues, be it either the user's fault,
or wgpu implementations'.
To aid these scenarios, a new [API tracing infrastructure][wgpu-pr-tracing]
was built into the core.
It's now possible to replay user's `wgpu` workloads in a separate player
on an entirely different platform.

In gfx-rs land, @mistodon created a nice [series of tutorials][gfx-hal-tutorials]
for the gfx-hal API.

  ![Ignite Code editor and Media player](ignite-code-media.gif)

- Play Mode window to play and test your game directly in the editor:

  ![Ignite Play Mode window](ignite-play-mode.jpeg)

- Additionaly new procedural macro was introduced into Oxygengine, this macro
  allows to bake information about types that will tell Ignite how to edit data of
  this types:

  ![Oxygengine Proc macro](ignite-proc-macro.png)

There was an additional work done within Oxygengine ecosystem, which is
[Chrobry](chrobry) crate - data driven template engine which is used in Ignite
as part of tool that allows to create new projects from templates provided by
plugins imported into Ignite editor.

If you want to be up to date with Oxygengine ecosystem progress, make sure to
follow project on GitHub and see [Oxygengine Project board](oxygengine-project).
