Welcome to the 18th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Teki (敵)][teki]

![teki preview](teki.gif)

[Teki][teki] is a free and open-source fangame of the [Tōhō] series
using [SDL2] and [Legion] for ECS. Thanks to WebAssembly - via [wasm-pack]
\-, teki can be played [online][teki-online].

It is aimed to be a shoot ’em up game with "lots of bullets"
a.k.a danmaku 弾幕 - literally "barrage" or "bullet curtain" in japanese.

The project is still at a “very” early stage of development (Dec. 2020).

_Fish game gameplay footage._

[Fishgame][fishgame] is an online multiplayer game, created in a
collaboration between [Nakama][nakama], an open-source scalable game
server, and the [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/) game engine.

### [Oicana][oicana]

![oicana game play](oicana.png)
_Solving puzzles to build towers_

[Oicana][oicana] is a tower defense game with puzzle aspects submitted to Mini
jam 71 [on itch][oicana-itch] by [M1nd0fRafa3l][rafael-itch] and
[@nikl_me][nikl-twitter]. The game was written using the Rust game engine
[Bevy][bevy].

Colorless puzzle pieces try to reach your base. Your towers have to shoot at
the pieces to uncover their color. After defeating a piece, it will try to run
away and you should catch it to upgrade your towers or build new ones.

Following the game jam the tower upgrades where improved and game audio was
changed to use [Kira][kira-sound] via an
[experimental bevy plugin][kira-plugin].

### [A/B Street]

![A/B Street in Cambridge](abstreet.gif)

[A/B Street] by [@dabreegster] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
suppot for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage.

In January, [Bruce] implemented variable traffic signal timing, dedicated
cycle-paths and pedestrian plazas were imported, [Michael] and [Yuwen]
overhauled the UI buttons, and we finished day/night toggling. Loading on the
[web][abst-web] and starting scenarios is also much faster!

### Paddlers

![A happy duck and sign showing: Paddlers version 0.2.0](paddlers_v0.2.jpeg)

[Paddlers] ([GitHub][paddlers-gh], [Online Demo][paddlers-demo]) by [@jakmeier]
is an MMORTS for the browser, developed as an experimental hobby project.

This month, version 0.2.0 has been released, which removes all dependencies to
[Stdweb] and [Quicksilver] while keeping the game itself virtually unchanged.
In the process, a part of the code of Paddlers moved to [Paddle], a new
framework for 2D browser games running on desktop and mobile phones.
More details on that are available [here][paddlers-article].

Many new features for Paddle and Paddlers are already in the pipeline, so stay
tuned for more exciting updates in the next monthly newsletter!

### [SeniorSKY]

![SeniorSKY](3.png)
_Over the mountains in Slovakia_

[SeniorSKY]
is a flight simulator which uses Vulkan API, developed by [@pmathia0].

As an aerospace engineering student, Peter has always been interested how
a flight simulator works under the hood.

The development of SeniorSKY started as a hobby project during university
studies.

SeniorSKY uses real-world elevation data with 1 arc
second precision and can render the whole globe in real dimensions.
During the flight, the terrain tiles are loaded dynamically based
on real GPS coordinates of airplane, with a decreasing level of detail
further from the camera. This is achieved using a combination
of a terrain-quad-tree and GPU tessellation.

SeniorSKY also implements basic rendering of sky, atmosphere and fog.

To be able to simulate a flight, the application temporarily integrates 3rd party
flight dynamics engine called JSBSim. Meanwhile, development of own, custom
flight dynamics is already in progress.

### [Dwarf World][dwarf-world]

![Dwarf World](dwarfworld_lights.gif)

[Dwarf World][dwarf-world] by [Alex Ene][@_AlexEne_] has added a couple
of updates and improvements:

- Dynamic lights and light propagation so deeper caves are darker.
- An in-game feedback button that people can use to report bugs or
just give general feedback.
- All random numbers are from seeded generators so it makes bugs easier
to reproduce.
- A big chunk of a replay system is finished.
This should help a lot with reproducing issues. Plus, it's really fun to watch.
- Bug fixes and performance improvements, mostly related to
rendering and culling systems.

If you're interested in keeping a closer eye on the project and monitor
it's progress,
you can join the game's [discord channel][dwarf-world-discord].
That's where the pre-alpha builds will drop there once they are
ready to be seen by a wider audience.

### Stellary 2

![Stellary 2 Banner](stellary_2_banner.jpg)

Stellary 2 by [@CoffeJunkStudio][coffe-junk-studio] is a 3D
real-time artillery game in which the player has to destroy all enemy planets in
order to defend his own from extinction.

Based on the [SimJam 2020][simjam-2020] game
"[Stellary][stellary]", the studio is now
working on this sequel with their self-developed "Sphere Engine". It will
feature an underlying physically based gravity simulation, powering the space
battles in different solar systems. You can find regular updates on
[Twitter][coffe-junk-studio].

By the way: "Stellary 2" is just a working title, feel free to drop them a PM on
Twitter if you have a flash of inspiration!

[Bounty Bros.] is a prototype dungeon crawler game in the spirit of _Legend of
Zelda: Link to the Past_. The game is being developed by [Katharos Technology]
as a playground for a future commercial game, along with a custom 2D engine
built on top of [Bevy].

The engine, which is unnamed so far, will be Open Sourced soon and will be
designed to make it very easy to make games with a similar gameplay and style,
primarily by simply writing YAML configuration files and integrating with
[LDtk].
