Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Rust Game Development Workgroup’s
monthly (hopefully!) newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

8-12 important news with their own sections.

Ideal section structure is:
- image/GIF,

- and discussion links.

If needed, section can be split into subsections with "------" delimiter.

### [Survey from the Rust GameDev Working Group][survey] 📋

Interested (maybe already invested?) in using Rust for game development?
Please set aside a brief moment to answer this short survey about
the current state of our GD ecosystem and what the GD working group
can do to nurture it. 🌱

While we'd greatly appreciate a modicum of identifying information
so we can easily connect with you for further discussions,
sharing that information is optional.
Only 3 questions in this survey are mandatory and we've saved
the most important one for last.

The survey is now being processed for publishing.
We’re still accepting responses until the survey has been published
and subsequently closed for good.

### [This Month in Rustsim \#7 (June − July 2019)][rustsim_7]

![CCD sub-steps](ccd_substeps.svg)

[nphysics] 0.12 release contains several long awaited features:

- The support for linear and non-linear _continuous-collision detection (CCD)_
  with colliders on rigid bodies and sensors.
  There's [a brand new page of the user guide][ccd guide] about it.
- Rigid body _velocity damping_: this allows to artificially
  slow down some bodies. This is essential for, e.g.,
  top-down 2D games where traditional coulomb friction cannot be used.
- Rigid body _maximum velocity_ limit: it is possible to force a rigid body
  to never get a velocity higher than a threshold.
- The possibility to use _custom containers_ for bodies,
  colliders, joints, and force generators.
  This helps overcoming some difficulties related to borrowing,
  and also help for the integration of nphysics with other solutions.
  The physics world structures will no longer own those containers.

With [ncollide] 0.20, it is now possible to compute the time of impact
between two shapes undergoing an arbitrary rigid motion.
This is known as non-linear time-of-impact computation.
This is used by the new CCD integration on nphysics 0.12.

Watch [a "CCD support on nphysics 0.12" video][ccd youtube]
or [play with the online demo yourself][nphysics examples]
(choose "CCD" in the "Select example" menu).

### [RUZZT]

![RUZZT screenshot](ruzzt.png)

[@yokljo] published [RUZZT] - a [ZZT] game engine clone written in Rust.

> My wife and I wrote this as a fun exercise, and went a lot further with it
> than originally anticipated. We wanted to try to replicate the original
> game's behaviour by simply looking at it running in Dosbox and seeing
> if we could make RUZZT do the same thing.
> This means the code architecture is likely very different
> from the original game.
>
> Eventually we did get far enough that it seemed like a waste of time
> to try to guess how some specific things were implemented,
> so we used a disassembler to make sure various behaviours worked correctly.

- 🌶️main menu
- 🏠build menu
- ⛹️player selection menu

### [gfx-hal 0.3 and wgpu 0.3](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/wgpu-v0-3-is-released)

![Mipmap example](gfx-mipmap.png)

`gfx-hal` is a low-overhead Vulkanic GPU API in Rust.
Version 0.3 is published that includes:

- MSAA resolves
- events API
- building Vulkan backend on Apple platforms
- "readonly" storage support in DX12 backend
- WASM and compute support in GL backend
- lots of fixes and improvements in all backends

_Discussions:
[/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/cnvfrm/gfxhal03_release_notes)_

------

`wgpu` is a safe, modern and portable GPU API for native platforms and the Web.
It's based on gfx-hal and Rendy.
Our implementation and its Rust wrapper `wgpu-rs` have reached version 0.3.
Major improvements:

- API is (mostly) updated to the upstream WebGPU working group spec
- internal deadlock protection
- `raw-window-handle` support
- individual tracking of texture array layers and mipmap levels
- more API features:
  - multisampling
  - indirect draw and dispatch
  - stencil masks and reference values
- more examples!
- more state validation!

### [luminance 0.31](https://phaazon.net/blog/luminance-0.31)

[luminance] is a type-safe, type-level and stateless Rust graphics framework.

luminance v0.31 was released by [@phaazon].
This version brings [LOTS of major changes and bugfixes][luminance changelog],
including two new crates:

- [luminance-derive](https://crates.io/crates/luminance-derive) -
  provides several procedural derive macros you can use to easily implement
  all required traits to work with luminance.
  Especially, some traits that are unsafe can be implemented
  in a safe way with that crate.
- [luminance-glutin](https://crates.io/crates/luminance-glutin) -
  the windowing crate support for [glutin].

Also, two ways to learn luminance were added:

> - The [examples][luminance examples]. They are like unit tests:
>   each introduces and focuses on a very specific aspect or feature.
>   You should read them if you are interested in given feature.
>   They’re not well suited to learn from scratch
>   and they are weaker than a structured tutorial but more concise.
>
> - The [wiki](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs/wiki).
>   It contains various chapters, including tutorials and onboarding newcomers.
>   It will not provide you with the best description of a given feature
>   as it focuses more on the overall comprehension and explaining
>   than code directly.
