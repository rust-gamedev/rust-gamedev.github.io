## [Are We Game Yet?][awgy] Updates

[Are We Game Yet?][awgy] is a website cataloguing the Rust gamedev ecosystem,
with hundreds of links to crates, games and helpful resources.

[![Are We Game Yet? homepage](awgy.png)][awgy]

This month, it received some major updates:

- All of the site's data files have been unified into a consistent TOML schema,
  making it easier to add new links.
- Categories have been added for games and resources, and you can now
  add an item to multiple categories without duplicating the data.
- Page load times have been reduced (especially on the homepage).
- The styling has been improved to make the site look better on mobile,
  and to resolve some accessibility issues.

[Ownership was also recently transferred across to the gamedev working group][awgy-wg],
to allow for more people to help with maintainance.

There's never been a better time to add your projects to the site,
so [please come and contribute][awgy-contribute]!

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Rolling mountain landscape](veloren1.png)

^ _Rolling mountain landscape_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG
inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Cube World.

At the beginning of the month, the team met for a 0.6 intro meeting.
It was decided that 0.6 would focus on things for the player to do,
and hence will be called "The Content Update".

Research has been done on multiple areas this month.
One domain is level of detail, which is allowing mountains off in the distance
to be rendered much faster.
Another domain is server persistence.
Finding a way for the server to efficiently persist player information
is a large part of what is needed for The Content Update.

Here is the February changelog:

```text
- Fixed NPCs attacking the player forever after killing them
- Extend run sfx to small animals to prevent sneak attacks by geese
- Added sfx for wielding/unwielding weapons
- Added new orc hairstyles
- Added gamma setting
- Configurable fonts
- Translation status tracking
- Fixed /give_exp ignoring player argument
- Allow spawning individual pet species, not just generic body kinds
- Added daily Mac builds
- Removed highlighting of non-collectible sprites
- Added zoomable and rotatable minimap
- Added rotating orientation marker to main-map
- Brighter / higher contrast main-map
- Added music system
```

![Hanging out](veloren2.png)

In March, there will be a heavy focus on completing level of detail work
as well as persistence. Modding support will be explored further.
Player achievements will be merged into the game,
and we will start looking at where more content can be added.

### [Oxidator][oxidator]

[![Gameplay demo: two giant tank armies clashing](oxidator-play.gif)][oxidator-video-play]

^ _gameplay demo (35000 units)_

[Oxidator][oxidator] by [@Ruddle] is a real-time strategy game/engine
written with Rust and WebGPU.
It's inspired by Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander, Spring Engine,
and Zero-k.

The project's goal is to provide a modern, carefully crafted,
minimal and highly constrained set of tools for players/designers
to create mods without programming knowledge.

Some of the current features:

- Simulation:
  working draft of flock behavior and collision detection,
  basic health and damage computation,
  construction and repair;
- Rendering: basic display of a heightmap & 3D models (with instancing),
  fxaa, screen-space reflections;
- UI: select units (picking and rectangle selection),
  move & build orders;
- Multiplayer: working PoC localhost tcp client/server;
- Map editor: raise, lower, flatten, blur, noise pencil;
- Unit editor: basic editor with joint & mesh selection and parameter editing
  (speed, turn rate, health, etc);

### [Univer City v1.0 and Open Source Release][univer-1-0-opensource]

[![logo](univer-logo.jpg)][univer-steam]

[UniverCity][univer-steam] is an isometric university management game:

> Manage your staff, professors and students and try
> and build the best UniverCity around!
> Build up your UniverCity solo or against friends and build many different
> types of classes whilst trying to ensure students get good grades,
> or maybe just try and build the best looking UniverCity.

This month, [v1.0 was released on Steam][univer-1-0-opensource]
along with [releasing the game's sources under GPL-3][univer-source].

> This update _marks the end of development for now_
> and adds in some basic workshop support.

![Demo: builing a classroom](univer-city-demo.gif)

> The license is GPL-3 and the code is the same
> as the version released on Steam
> (the Steam version is built with the 'steam' feature enabled).
> Due to the GPL licensing the steamworks support is disabled
> by default which breaks things like the 'modding' menu and multiplayer.
>
> The assets _are not included_ with the release
> and will have to be copied from the game on Steam.

### [Everpuzzle]

![Everpuzzle preview](everpuzzle-020-preview.gif)

[Everpuzzle] is a Tetris Attack like action-puzzle game written in Rust.

Everpuzzle aims to become a similar game like Tetris Attack and expand on its concepts.
The project was recently rewritten with minimal dependencies to achieve small
compile times and gain more control over the underlying engine architecture.
In the past Everpuzzle was using Amethyst with ECS,
however there were some issues that made development difficult.
Everpuzzle's big goals are AI, Multiplayer and different Game modes.

Big changes coming in version 0.2, full list [here](https://github.com/Skytrias/everpuzzle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md):

- Gamepad support (singleplayer)
- Multiple grids
- AI Bot
- Better Randomization of blocks
- Combos / Chains - with Highlighting

### [Antorum]

![Spider NPCs](antorum.jpg)

[Antorum] is a multiplayer RPG where players build their characters
and fight against the growing threats on the isle.
The game server is authoritative and written in Rust,
while the client is written in Unity/C#.

This month, the focus was on cooking skill. This includes recipes and cookware.
Players will need a cooking appliance, such as a stove or campfire
to cook some Chonkrat Stew inside a pot.
A heavy refactor to the interaction system had to be made,
as well as changes to networking.

Check out te full devlog: [#18 "Cooking"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/18).

### [Scale]

![Traffic lights](scale.png)

[Scale] is a recent project about modern day society simulation from the
bottom-up by [Uriopass].

In February, the Inspector for specs entities was mostly finished and the
traffic simulation made great progress.
A second [blog post][scale-blog-post] was released about it.

### [Ultimate Scale][ultimate-scale]

![Ultimate scale screenshot showing winds and blips](ultimate_scale.png)

[Ultimate Scale][ultimate-scale] is a puzzle game in which you build
increasingly large machines to solve increasingly difficult problems.
The game consists of wind and blips.
Wind propagates along pipes and causes blips to move.
Blips, in turn, activate blocks.

[Leod] is currently working on the core design: How to make the game fun and
what blocks to add. He posted about their thoughts and progress on a
[Reddit comment][ultimate-scale-post].
Regularly, videos are posted on their
[youtube channel][ultimate-scale-youtube-channel] showing different machines
made in game such as an [extensible counter modulo 10][ultimate-scale-video-1]
and a [buffer][ultimate-scale-video-2].

A custom 3D rendering pipeline based on glium called [Rendology] was developed
for this project. A [blog post][rendology-blog-post] talks about its design and
relation to Ultimate Scale.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [Fix Your Time Step in Rust and GGEZ][fyt-ggez]

[![Demonstration of interpolation](fyt-ggez.gif)][fyt-ggez]

[joetsoi] has written [a blog post][fyt-ggez], demonstrating how the concepts
from the well-known '[Fix Your Timestep][fyt]' article can be applied
when making games with Rust and GGEZ.

The examples are very well explained, and can easily be translated
to other engines, so it's worth checking out even if you're not a GGEZ user!

### savefile 0.6.1

[savefile] is a serialization crate used to effortlessly serialize rust crates
and enums into a binary format. Anything implementing the `Write` trait can
be serialized and deserialized. First-class versioning support and introspection
are some other features available.

Version 0.6.1 includes a fix and should be updated to if compilation using
the savefile-derive crate produces a "`SaveFileError` not found" compiler error.

For details, see the [github page][savefile-github] or the [savefile documentation].

### specs 0.16

[specs] is an entity-component system (ECS) library, designed for high
performance. This update increases the MSRV to 1.38 and removes the `"nightly"`
feature.

In this version, the [panic message has been improved][panic_improve] to include
the name of the type that is accessed on stable Rust, as well as suggestions for
how to fix the issue. Prior to `specs 0.16`, retrieving a resource that had not
been added to the `World` panics with an obscure *"resource not found"* message,
and the `"nightly"` feature was necessary to discover what resource that is.

In addition, the [`Send` and `Sync` trait constraints are
removed][specs_constraints] from resources and `Component`s when the
`"parallel"` feature is disabled -- enabling types such as
`wasm_bindgen::JsValue` to be used with non-parallel `specs`.

For more details, please see the [`specs` changelog].

### [weasel]

[weasel] by [@Trisfald] is a customizable battle system for turn-based games.

- Simple way to define the combat's rules,
  taking advantage of Rust's strong type system.
- Battle events are collected into a timeline to support save and restore,
  replays, and more.
- Client/server architecture; all battle events are verified by the server.
- Minimal performance overhead.

> The idea behind this crate is to provide a structured
> and safe framework to manage the game state.
> Users can create a battle and evolve it by applying events.
> Then, weasel takes care of keeping a historical timeline.
> It also help with serializing/deserializing save files
> or sharing and verifying events between clients and server.
> The game logic is defined through traits, which is nice because
> it can benefit from Rust's type system and compile time checks.

Check out [examples][weasel-examples] to see how it works in practice.

### Rust on [RG-300 Consoles][rg-300]

[![Real-world demo of using Rust on RG-300](rg-300.jpeg)][rg-300-video]

[@alexpdp7 shared their experience][rg-300-rust-ann]
of writing an interactive application in Rust
for the retro [RG-300][rg-300] console.

> The process is complex for a lot of reasons:
>
> - Cross-compiling for MIPS is tough <...>
> - Graphics is done through the Linux framebuffer <...>
> - Sound uses old-style Linux OSS <...>
>
> It's a bit clunky, but it works!
> There are quite a few devices with very similar hardware
> this should work with.
> It should be possible to make simple games for such devices,
> which I find particularly motivating :)

You can find a working example that does graphics, sound and controls
with some explanations at [alexpdp7/retrofw2-rust][retrofw2-rust].

> to make it easy to pick-and-choose the features you need.
>
> - `rltk` crate wraps bracket-lib and re-exports
>   in the `rltk::` and `rltk::prelude` namespace.
>   This preserves compatibility with all existing RLTK projects.
> - `bracket-algorithm`-traits exposes the traits required
>   for the various algorithm systems in other crates.
> - `bracket-color` is my RGB/HSV color management system.
> - `bracket-geometry` exposes various geometric primitives and helpers.
>   Supports other crates.
> - `bracket-noise` is a port of Auburn's FastNoise to Rust.
