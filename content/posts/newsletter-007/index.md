Welcome to the seventh issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

Features:
- Common FPS elements: bots, items, weapons.
- Single game mode - deathmatch.
- More or less modern graphics (shadows, deferred shading, particle systems etc.)
- Fully animated bots using animation blending state machines.
- Single map - something like legendary Q3DM6.
- Path finding using navmesh
- Save/load functionality
- GUI: main menu, options, HUD, leader board (using [rg3d-ui library][rg3d-ui])
- Binaural sound (using [rg3d-sound library][rg3d-sound])

[Akigi][akigi] is a multiplayer online world where most believe that humans are inferior.

This month saw a heavy focus on the web client. An alpha release is slated for April 9th, 2020. Lots of client refactoring was done, and experiments were run in the browser.

Some of February's updates:

- [Input Event Processor System](https://devjournal.akigi.com/february-2020/2020-02-09.html#input-event-processor-system);
- [Terrain Loading and Rendering](https://devjournal.akigi.com/february-2020/2020-02-16.html#terrain-loading-and-rendering);
- [User Interface Elements](https://devjournal.akigi.com/february-2020/2020-02-16.html#user-interface-elements);
- [The WebGL Renderer](https://devjournal.akigi.com/february-2020/2020-02-16.html#the-webgl-renderer);
