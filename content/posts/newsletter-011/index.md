Welcome to the eleventh issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [rust-psp](https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-psp)

Just what everyone's always wanted, Rust on the Sony PSP üòÜ

![demo-gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-psp/master/demo.gif)

[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/psp) [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/psp)

This project is a port and improvement of the unofficial C/C++ PSPSDK from 
2005. It does not require a custom GCC toolchain to be installed. Only Rust 
nightly and a cargo subcommand.

#### cargo-psp and the psp crate

The psp crate provides a psp::sys submodule that houses the entire Sony PSP 
API. We are working to have theseinterfaces merged into the libc crate.
The PSP unfortunately uses non-standard dynamic linking, 
(and some libraries are statically linked!), so function definitions 
marked extern are not enough. Eventually we will wrap this sys lib with a more
rust-friendly library.

Rather than patching LLVM or rustc, the rust-psp team has also merged a 
mipsel-sony-psp target upstream, and published cargo-psp. This is a subcommand 
that works exactly like cargo build, except it also builds the crate into a 
PSP-specific executable format called PRX and packages that into an EBOOT.PBP.

The crate has reached full user-mode parity with the unofficial C/C++ SDK. 
Kernel-mode support still needs to be worked on. Aside from library 
imports, there is also support for PSP-specific custom assembly instructions
via the `vfpu_asm!` macro, with no need for a custom compiler toolchain.
There is also optional embedded-graphics support and a function to benchmark
or time your code.

#### Next Steps

The next major milestone for rust-psp is std support.
