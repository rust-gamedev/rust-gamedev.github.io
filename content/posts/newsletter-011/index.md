Welcome to the eleventh issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [glam](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs)

[glam] is a simple and fast linear algebra crate for games and graphics.

This month [glam 0.9] was published to crates.io. This update is a breaking
change from 0.8.

In 0.9 the `Vec3` type was changed from being a 128 byte SIMD vector type to a
tuple of three floats. This changes the size of `Vec3` from 16 bytes to 12 bytes
and the alignment from 16 bytes to 4 bytes. This might not effect all users but
if `Vec3` was used in a context where the size or alignment mattered, such as in
FFI or as input to shaders, this could cause breakage.

The SIMD parts of `Vec3` were moved to a new type, `Vec3A` (`A` for Aligned)
which is 16 byte aligned and thus 16 bytes in size.  The `Vec3A` type is still
there for users who want the performance benefits of the SIMD implementation.

The motivation for this change was that it is potentially surprising and
confusing for new users that the `Vec3` type was not 12 bytes. Also it's common
that users needed a `Vec3` that was just 12 bytes.

While glam is reasonably stable it has not yet reached a 1.0 release, so it
seemed like now is the time to address such issues in the API.
