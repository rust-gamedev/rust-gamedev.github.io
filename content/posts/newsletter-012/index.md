Welcome to the twelfth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Canon Collision][canon-collision]

![Basic Projectiles](canon-collision.png)

[Canon Collision][canon-collision] by [@rukai] is an Undertale + Homestuck
fan-made platform fighter with powerful tools for modding.

This month, he started work on the project again after taking a break.
Notable changes:

- [basic projectiles](https://twitter.com/thisIsRukai/status/1287377878460456963),
- [WIP grab implementation (with some humorous results)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSrBGpT-Ebs),
- [New animations + attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaPkRSNhoSM)
- and [custom shaders](https://twitter.com/thisIsRukai/status/1279324105125163008).

### [Sandbox]

![Sandbox screenshot](sandbox_screenshot.png)

[Sandbox] is a falling sand game by JMS55 that provides a variety of fun
particle types to place, and then you get to watch the resulting interactions!

As they didn't make it in time for last month's newsletter, this month's edition
covers the work they did in June and July:

- Released version 1.0 and 1.1, created a flatpak package and associated metadata,
  and published it to [Flathub].
- Several new particles such as Fire, Mirror, Glitch, and some hidden ones,
  and tweaked or overhalled almost every other particle!
- A fancy new glow post process effect for Acid/Fire/Electricity,
  created using wgpu-rs compute shaders.
  - As a precursor to this, they made a PR to the pixels crate that removes the
    old RenderPass approach in favor of giving the user direct access to wgpu.
- Made a slick new icon and background for the game.
- Added a video recording feature using gstreamer-rs and x264enc,
  and then later removed it (for now).
  - Moving from recording the raw texture generated for pixels
    to the post-processed texture from wgpu
    involved a major overhaul, and it proved too glitchy and slow.
    Hopefully it will be revived later, in the form of recording user inputs.
- Many structural improvements, such as less glitchy particle
  placement with Bresenham's line algorithm,
  better error handling, and ensuring particles
  are only ever stored on the heap.
- Performance improvements, including generating noise in a separate thread.
- Currently WIP: UI using imgui.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Rust on iOS with SDL2][rust-ios-sdl2-post]

[![Rust on iOS with SDL2 demo](rust-ios-sdl2-screenshot.png)][rust-ios-sdl2-post]

[@aclysma] published a [tutorial][rust-ios-sdl2-post] that describes setting up
Rust/SDL2 on iOS. The resulting app can run in the simulator as well as on
physical devices. [SDL2][sdl2-project] is a mature library providing basic rendering,
audio, and input support. It can also be used to set up an opengl or vulkan
surface. This demo is using [Rust-SDL2][rust-sdl2] for bindings.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [wgpu][wgpu-site]

![procgen dynamic "grass field"](tuitui-grass-field.jpeg)

^ _[@MacTuitui]'s everyday [nannou] experiement #1274_

The work is ongoing to validate all the incoming commands and guarantee API safety.
Special thanks to [@GabrielMajeri] for helping to convert assertions
into errors at `wgpu` level.
The wgpu devs are also introspecting shader requirements
and matching them against the pipelines, but this will take more effort
before it will become universally available.

[@cwfitzgerald] has been busy adding a few handy native-only extensions,
such as descriptor indexing and push constants.
They have also converted the project's logging to [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing),
setting up the infrastructure for CPU profiling.

In the past 2 months, the API for descriptor structures in `wgpu-rs`
have been undergoing a turbulent period.
First, non-exhaustive semantics led to introduction of constructors.
Then, efforts to reduce code duplication inside `wgpu` project has led to the
[bovine invasion](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/pull/460) on wgpu-rs API side.
The devs are figuring out the plan to address that with a builder pattern now,
which will address both the `Cow`s and non-exhaustives,
hopefully putting the end to the turbulence.

In the meantime, `wgpu-rs` ecosystem is flourishing with applications and libraries.
The [showcase gallery](https://wgpu.rs/#showcase) was updated with a few shiny images.

------

Finally, [@kunalmohan] has been busy
[implementing WebGPU in Servo][webgpu-in-servo], based on `wgpu`.
Thanks to this work, Servo is currently ahead of Gecko
in terms of API being up-to-date and covered üéâ.
It's already capable of rendering most of the examples,
and the devs are looking forward to the day when the same Rust code
(rendering with `wgpu-rs`) will be deployable to the Web,
and viewable from Firefox, Servo, Chrome, and other browsers.

### Vulkan Renderer (Name TBD)

[![Vulkan renderer on iOS prototype](vulkan-renderer-prototype.jpeg)][vulkan-renderer-prototype-video]

^ _Click to watch [the video demo][vulkan-renderer-prototype-video] running on iOS._

[@aclysma] published a [new vulkan-based renderer][renderer-prototype] that
uses [atelier-assets] to load 3D scenes exported from blender.

> The objective of this repo is to build a scalable, flexible, data driven
> renderer. Scalable in the sense of performance as well as suitability for
> use in large, real-world projects. This means streaming, LODs, visibility
> systems, and multi-threaded draw call submission need to be possible.
> Additionally it means thinking through how an asset pipeline would work for
> a team with dedicated artists and supporting workflow-friendly features
> like hot reloading assets, possibly on remote devices.

This video demonstrates the renderer running on iOS and receiving asset updates
via wifi. The scene is "sponza" exported from blender. Vulkan is supported on
windows and linux natively. Support for macOS and iOS is via the
well-established [MoltenVK][moltenvk] project.

The demo was ported from PC to iOS over a single weekend and out of
approximately 300 crate dependencies (including complex, OS-specific ones like
tokio), all but a few worked out-of-the-box!
