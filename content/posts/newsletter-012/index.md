### [ochre][4k-post] - 4K Intro

[![Youtube preview: mountains & spheres](4k-into-youtube.jpeg)][4k-video]
_Click to [watch the demo on Youtube][4k-video]._

Jani Peltonen has recently released a [4K intro][4k-src]
which is completely written in Rust and GLSL
and published an article ["Writing a winning 4K intro in Rust"][4k-post]:

> A 4K intro is a demo where the entire program (including any data)
> has to be 4096 bytes or less so it is important
> that the code is as space efficient as possible.
> Rust has a bit of a reputation for creating bloated executables so I wanted
> to find out if is possible to create very space efficient code with it.

### [Robo Instructus: 1 Year Later][robo-year]

![game logo + OS logos](robo-os.jpg)

One year ago [Alex Butler] released the "[Robo Instructus][robo-site]" puzzle game
on [Steam][robo-steam] & [itch.io][robo-itch].

This month Alex released a devlog post ["Robo Instructus: 1 Year Later"][robo-year]
about how well the game did after the release:
sales by platform/country/OS, player feedback & reviews, etc.

> People mostly don’t publish sales figures,
> I guess it makes more business sense to be vague.
> But maybe these will be helpful or interesting in some way.

Also, Alex continues to maintain and polish the game: [1.29 version][robo-1-29]
brings auto-scrolling improvements, better lang parsing,
bugfixes, and dependency updates.

### pGLOWrpg

![Improved river pathfinding, paths respect topography](pglowrpg_12.gif)

The [@pGLOWrpg] (Procedurally Generated Living Open World RPG) is a long-term
project in development by [@Roal_Yr], which aims to be a text-based game with
maximum portability and accessibility and focus on interactions and emergent
narrative.

For the past month(s) the main focus of the development was on the river
generation system in the worldgen. Main features of the river generator are:

- High robustness with most edge cases covered;
- Single-pass with subsequent iterations generation, with numerous options to
  tweak the process for either precision of the pattern or speed of generation;
- Rivers are sorted upon intersections, their widths are adjusted, waterfalls
  are formed when necessary;
- Inflow and outflow directions are recorded for each cell, which allows
  following the river upstream or downstream;
- Simple yet effective erosion model implemented, which ensures no upwards flows
  are allowed;
- Each stream has its unique ID, which will later be linked to the stream data;
- Streams have 12 orders of magnitude from smallest brooks to major rivers;
- All the options are available to user under "General", "Advanced" and
  "Very advanced" sections for any level of fine-tuning.

Further development will involve re-factoring of the code and making it ready
to be published prior to implementing new features. For small dev reports follow
[@pGLOWrpg] on Twitter.

### [Sandbox]

![Sandbox screenshot](sandbox_screenshot.png)

[Sandbox] is a falling sand game by JMS55 that provides a variety of fun
particle types to place, and then you get to watch the resulting interactions!

As they didn't make it in time for last month's newsletter, this month's edition
covers the work they did in June and July:

- Released version 1.0 and 1.1, created a flatpak package and associated metadata,
  and published it to [Flathub].
- Several new particles such as Fire, Mirror, Glitch, and some hidden ones,
  and tweaked or overhalled almost every other particle!
- A fancy new glow post process effect for Acid/Fire/Electricity,
  created using wgpu-rs compute shaders.
  - As a precursor to this, they made a PR to the pixels crate that removes the
    old RenderPass approach in favor of giving the user direct access to wgpu.
- Made a slick new icon and background for the game.
- Added a video recording feature using gstreamer-rs and x264enc,
  and then later removed it (for now).
  - Moving from recording the raw texture generated for pixels
    to the post-processed texture from wgpu
    involved a major overhaul, and it proved too glitchy and slow.
    Hopefully, it will be revived later, in the form of recording user inputs.
- Many structural improvements, such as less glitchy particle
  placement with Bresenham's line algorithm,
  better error handling, and ensuring particles
  are only ever stored on the heap.
- Performance improvements, including generating noise in a separate thread.
- Currently WIP: UI using imgui.

### [shotcaller]

[shotcaller] is a WIP quick (~7mins) ASCII-rendered RTS/MOBA game.

> In the way "MOBA" games such as DOTA2 or LoL are usually played,
> the captain of the team is the default shotcaller.
>
> > The shotcaller needs to be unbiased and not have tunnel vision.
> > You need to be able to think in the future and tell
> > what would happen if you did this or that.
> > This becomes crucial when deciding to base-race or teleport back to defend.
> > ~reddit-user
>
> Everyone on the team can play the part of Shotcaller on occasion.
> The act of shotcalling is not typically the most prevalent activity of any player,
> even for a captain — after all, they also need to play their hero.
>
> But in this game, all you do is shotcalling and big-picture strategizing.
> The game plays as if you were controlling the 6th-person-in-the-booth “coach” player,
> and your team (of AI-played bots) actually follows
> your instructions to the letter, within their designed constraints.

The game is in an early stage of development,

_Click to watch [footage from the game's current state][on-fps-game-2-youtube]._

On this update, [@pingFromHeaven] talks about the lighting implementation that
sets the tone for the game, how Rust is good at shortening the debugging
times, which is especially valuable when working directly with OpenGL and why
he doesn't describe what the game is about.

The next update is going to be about establishing the mood further, which
includes a more elaborate environment with more details, basic SFX and
particles.

### [An Introduction to Data-Oriented Design in Rust][dod]

![vector vs linked list perf](data_oriented_design.svg)

Data-Oriented Design is an approach to program optimization focused on
considering the features and limitations of the target hardware, and
carefully controlling the memory layout of data to take advantage of
those.

In [this article][dod], [jamesmcm][jamesmcm] provides benchmarks and
code for four example scenarios:

- [Array of Structs vs. Struct of Arrays][wikisoa]
- Branching in a hot loop
- Iteration in a vector vs. a linked list
- Monomorphisation vs. [Dynamic Dispatch][traitobj]

### [big-brain]

[big-brain] by [Kat Marchán] is a [utility AI] library for games,
built on the specs ECS.

> It lets you define complex, intricate AI behaviors for your entities
> based on their perception of the world.
> Definitions are almost entirely data-driven, using plain .ron files,
> and you only need to program considerations (entities that look at your game world),
> and actions (entities that perform actual behaviors upon the world).
> No other code is needed for actual AI behavior.

### [naia]

[naia] (**n**etworking **a**rchitecture for **i**nteractive **a**pplications)
is a cross-platform (currently WebAssembly & Linux) networking engine that intends
to make multiplayer game development in Rust dead simple and lightning fast.

> At the highest level, you register Event and Entity implementations
> in a module shared by Client & Server.
> Then, naia will facilitate sending/receiving those Events between Client & Server,
> and also keep a pool of tracked Entities synced with each Client
> for whom they are "in-scope".
> Entities are "scoped" to Clients with whom they share the same Room,
> as well as being sufficiently customizable to, for example,
> only keep Entities persisted & synced while within a Client's viewport
> or according to some other criteria.

[`raw-window-handle`]: https://crates.io/crates/raw-window-handle

### grr 0.8

[`grr`](https://github.com/msiglreith/grr) is a modern OpenGL 4.5+ wrapper.
It provides a cleaned up API built around Vulkan's naming scheme.
The latest release further pushes the crate towards
full compatibility with the core features.

Most notable changes:

- Added support for a bunch of Formats
- Extended transfer operations (Attachment <-> Host <-> Buffer <-> Image)
- Raw context access
- Shader & Pipeline log control
- Device submission control

Special thanks to [@masonium](https://github.com/masonium)
for contributing a lot of these features and fixes!

### [miniquad]

![miniquad ios](miniquad_ios.jpg)

[miniquad] is a safe and cross-platform rendering library
focused on portability and low-end platforms support.

This month opengl backend of miniquad was successfully ported to iOS.
With this update [macroquad], [good-web-game] and all the games
build directly with [miniquad] can be run on IOS, Android, WASM,
Linux, macOS and Windows!

### [wgpu][wgpu-site]

![procgen dynamic "grass field"](tuitui-grass-field.jpeg)
_[@MacTuitui]'s everyday [nannou] experiment #1274_

The work is ongoing to validate all the incoming commands and guarantee API safety.
Special thanks to [@GabrielMajeri] for helping to convert assertions
into errors at `wgpu` level.
The wgpu devs are also introspecting shader requirements
and matching them against the pipelines, but this will take more effort
before it will become universally available.

[@cwfitzgerald] has been busy adding a few handy native-only extensions,
such as descriptor indexing and push constants.
They have also converted the project's logging to [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing),
setting up the infrastructure for CPU profiling.

In the past 2 months, the API for descriptor structures in `wgpu-rs`
have been undergoing a turbulent period.
First, non-exhaustive semantics led to introduction of constructors.
Then, efforts to reduce code duplication inside `wgpu` project has led to the
[bovine invasion](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/pull/460) on wgpu-rs API side.
The devs are figuring out the plan to address that with a builder pattern now,
which will address both the `Cow`s and non-exhaustives,
hopefully putting an end to the turbulence.

In the meantime, `wgpu-rs` ecosystem is flourishing with applications and libraries.
The [showcase gallery](https://wgpu.rs/#showcase) was updated with a few shiny images.

------

Finally, [@kunalmohan] has been busy
[implementing WebGPU in Servo][webgpu-in-servo], based on `wgpu`.
Thanks to this work, Servo is currently ahead of Gecko
in terms of API being up-to-date and covered 🎉.
It's already capable of rendering most of the examples,
and the devs are looking forward to the day when the same Rust code
(rendering with `wgpu-rs`) will be deployable to the Web,
and viewable from Firefox, Servo, Chrome, and other browsers.

### [luminance v0.40][luminance-v0-40]

![logo](luminance-logo.svg)

[luminance] by [@phaazon] is a type-safe, type-level and stateless
graphics framework.

This month [luminance v0.40 got released][luminance-v0-40].
Some of the highlights:

- The complete backend/architecture redesign.
- A new platform crate has appeared:
  [luminance-sdl2], which adds support for the sdl2 crate.
- [luminance-webgl] and luminance-web-sys, to support the Web!
- A [luminance-examples-web] crate is available to test with `yarn` easily.
- [luminance-front], which is a front crate to ease working with luminance types.
- The type system experience has been greatly improved. Most of the time,
  you will not have to annotate types anymore — like Program or Tess.
- About `Tess`, a BIG update has landed, has it’s now heavily typed
  (vertex type, index type, vertex instance data type, memory interleaving type).
- More render states features, such as the possibility to enable or disable
  depth writes, separate RGB/alpha blending, etc. etc.
- Also, the [luminance book][luminance-book] got updated.

A complete changes list and a migration guide can be found
[in the CHANGELOG][luminance-v0-40-changelog].

luminance-0.41 got released a few days after to fix some type design problems with
the gates, and to enhance the error flow in graphics pipelines, revisited to be more
flexible and seamless.

Also, check out the
["The compile-time deinterleaving interface"][luminance-typesafe-deinterleaving]
blog post that delves deep into this new feature.

### [Graphene][graphene] - Vulkan Render Graph

![execution flow example](graphene.png)

[Graphene][graphene] is a Vulkan render graph. Still heavily a work in progress,
it is built to be a simpler abstraction over Vulkan, with long-term ambitions to
serve as a graphics test-bench.

Currently, it implements a mesh render pass followed by a chromatic aberration
post-process in less than [250 lines of Rust code][graphene_example_code].
Current features include easy Vulkan initialization, automatic swapchain
resizing, glTF mesh loading, and shader hot-reloading.
Check out a ["Render graphs" blog post][graphene_blog]
for a more in-depth introduction to the project.

### Vulkan Renderer (Name TBD)

[![Vulkan renderer on iOS prototype](vulkan-renderer-prototype.jpeg)][vulkan-renderer-prototype-video]
_Click to watch [the video demo][vulkan-renderer-prototype-video] running on iOS._

[@aclysma] published a [new vulkan-based renderer][renderer-prototype] that
uses [atelier-assets] to load 3D scenes exported from blender.

> The objective of this repo is to build a scalable, flexible, data driven
> renderer. Scalable in the sense of performance as well as suitability for
> use in large, real-world projects. This means streaming, LODs, visibility
> systems, and multi-threaded draw call submission need to be possible.
> Additionally it means thinking through how an asset pipeline would work for
> a team with dedicated artists and supporting workflow-friendly features
> like hot reloading assets, possibly on remote devices.

This video demonstrates the renderer running on iOS and receiving asset updates
via wifi. The scene is "sponza" exported from blender. Vulkan is supported on
windows and linux natively. Support for macOS and iOS is via the
well-established [MoltenVK][moltenvk] project.

The demo was ported from PC to iOS over a single weekend and out of
approximately 300 crate dependencies (including complex, OS-specific ones like
tokio), all but a few worked out-of-the-box!

### [Ludusavi]

![Demo of Ludusavi GUI](ludusavi.gif)

[Ludusavi] is a tool written in Rust by [@mtkennerly] for backing up PC game
save data. It has backup info for more than 7,000 games, is cross-platform for
Windows, Linux, and Mac, and has a GUI as well as a command line interface.
The GUI was created using the [Iced] crate.

The [backup info] is sourced from [PCGamingWiki] so that everyone can help to
expand the data, and it's stored in a documented format so that other backup
tools can share the same data set. A [plugin] for [Playnite] was also just
released.

### [Langcraft]

[Langcraft] is the Minecraft LLVM target you've never wanted.

Langcraft started as a dare to the `#lang-dev` channel of the Rust
Community Discord to be able to parse Rust code in Minecraft.
Naturally, it grew into a full code generator that can translate
most LLVM IR to
[Minecraft data packs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack),
the game's deliberately-limited in-game scripting language. Langcraft
is entirely language independent, so any language with an LLVM-based
compiler can (with the right API bindings) run in Minecraft. Currently,
bindings to both C and Rust exist. While not as visually impressive as
a redstone computer, Langcraft does stretch the bounds of the game quite
a bit, using jukeboxes for memory, armor stands to represent pointers,
and rearranging compiled code to make it run in the bounds of the data
packs' fixed instruction limit.

This is all, naturally, entirely useless. The project is also still
heavily work-in-progress and does not pretend to be stable, but it is
usable. A handwritten interpreter for a Rust-like language has already
been demonstrated running, and even more complex projects like [CHIP-8
emulators](https://github.com/Dhole/chip8-rs.git) function (albeit at
extremely slow speed).

[![youtube preview](shar-youtube.jpeg)][shar-trailer]
_Click to watch [SHAR's Greenlight trailer][shar-trailer]_

[SHAR][shar-itch] (Russian "Шар" - ball) by [@fedor_games] (author of [miniquad]/[macroquad])
is a 3rd-person online action game that aims to create unique experience
combining destructible world and team-based ball game.

> SHAR is an action combination of tactical and sports game in the destructible world.
> The rules are extremely simple: two teams, one ball.
> The team that carries the ball into the opponent's gates gets a score,
> the team with the most score at the end of the game is the winner.
> However, this is where things get interesting!
> Players have the variety of skills and tricks and destructible environment
> to fiddle around to slam the opponent and win the game.

Some of the game's features:

- A network-synchronized physics engine powered by bullet-rs;
- A bunch of physics-based player skills;
- Extensive build-in editors for game maps, skeletal animation,
  effects & particle systems;
- Modding support.

The game was built on top of a homegrown game engine using:
winit, glium, imgui-rs, [tinyecs], [awesomium-rs], [ears].

[![A screenshot from the recording](shar-talk.jpeg)][shar-talk]

During RustFest Zurich 2017, Fedor gave a self-descriptive talk
"SHAR: Rust's gamedev experience".
You can [watch the recording here][shar-talk].

The game was in active development around 2016-2017.
In 2017 the game [passed Steam Greenlight][shar-greenlight].
During 2018 [the project was suspended][shar-death].
