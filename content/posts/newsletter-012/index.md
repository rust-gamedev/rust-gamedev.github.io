Welcome to the twelfth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

^ _[@MacTuitui]'s everyday [nannou] experiement #1274_

The work is ongoing to validate all the incoming commands and guarantee API safety.
Special thanks to [@GabrielMajeri] for helping to convert assertions
into errors at `wgpu` level.
The wgpu devs are also introspecting shader requirements
and matching them against the pipelines, but this will take more effort
before it will become universally available.

[@cwfitzgerald] has been busy adding a few handy native-only extensions,
such as descriptor indexing and push constants.
They have also converted the project's logging to [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing),
setting up the infrastructure for CPU profiling.

In the past 2 months, the API for descriptor structures in `wgpu-rs`
have been undergoing a turbulent period.
First, non-exhaustive semantics led to introduction of constructors.
Then, efforts to reduce code duplication inside `wgpu` project has led to the
[bovine invasion](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/pull/460) on wgpu-rs API side.
The devs are figuring out the plan to address that with a builder pattern now,
which will address both the `Cow`s and non-exhaustives,
hopefully putting the end to the turbulence.

In the meantime, `wgpu-rs` ecosystem is flourishing with applications and libraries.
The [showcase gallery](https://wgpu.rs/#showcase) was updated with a few shiny images.

Finally, [@kunalmohan] has been busy
[implementing WebGPU in Servo][webgpu-in-servo], based on `wgpu`.
Thanks to this work, Servo is currently ahead of Gecko
in terms of API being up-to-date and covered üéâ.
It's already capable of rendering most of the examples,
and the devs are looking forward to the day when the same Rust code
(rendering with `wgpu-rs`) will be deployable to the Web,
and viewable from Firefox, Servo, Chrome, and other browsers.
