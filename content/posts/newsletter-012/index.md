Welcome to the twelfth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[Sandbox] is a falling sand game by JMS55 that provides a variety of fun
particle types to place, and then you get to watch the resulting interactions!

As they didn't make it in time for last month's newsletter, this month's edition
covers the work they did in June and July:

- Released version 1.0 and 1.1, created a flatpak package and associated metadata,
    and published it to [Flathub]
- Several new particles such as Fire, Mirror, Glitch, and some hidden ones,
    and tweaked or overhalled almost every other particle!
- A fancy new glow post process effect for Acid/Fire/Electricity,
    created using wgpu-rs compute shaders
    - As a precursor to this, they made a PR for pixels that removes the
    old RenderPass approach in favor of giving the user direct access to wgpu
- Made a slick new icon for the game
- Created a fancy new background
- Added a video recording feature using gstreamer-rs and x264enc,
    and then later removed it (for now)
    - Moving from recording the raw texture generated for pixels
    to the post-processed texture from wgpu
    involved a major overhaul, and it proved too glitchy and slow.
    Hopefully it will be revived later.
- Many structural improvements, such as less glitchy particle
    placement with Bresenham's line algorithm,
    better error handling, and ensuring particles
    are only ever stored on the stack
- Performance improvements, including generating noise in a separate thread
- And currently work in progress: An ImGui based UI
