Welcome to the twelfth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [This Month in Mun][mun-july]

[![Mun logo](mun-logo.png)][Mun]

[Mun] is a scripting language for gamedev focused on quick iteration times
that is written in Rust.

[Rustacean Station][rustacean] released [a podcast about Mun][rustacean-mun]
in which the Mun Core Team sat down with host Jeremy
to talk about why they chose Rust to develop Mun. If you are interested in
having an inside look into Mun's origins and evolution, we recommend you check
it out - or any of Rustacean Station's other podcasts for that matter!

Their additional [July updates][mun-july] include:

- initial support for the Language Server Protocol;
- a community entry for the [Make It or Break It content] of Spaceship
  recreated with Mun & Rust;
- CLI support for creating Mun projects;
- performance benchmarks and improvements;
- bugfixes and improved documentation.
