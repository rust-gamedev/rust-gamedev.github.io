monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Sulis][sulis] - a Turn-Based RPG

![chest and inventory with items](sulis-inventory.png)

[Sulis][sulis] is a Role Playing Game (RPG) with turn based, tactical combat,
deep character customization and an engaging storyline.
The game has been built from the ground up with modding
and custom content in mind.
Currently supported on Windows and Linux platforms.

The game is currently fully playable
and includes the first act of The Twin Expanse,
an old school RPG campaign in the vein of classic games
such as _Baldur's Gate_,
but mixing in modern elements from titles like
_Divinity: Original Sin_ and _Pillars of Eternity_.

The core game engine as well as the campaign
are still under heavy development.
Users are encouraged to [file issues with bugs][sulis-issues],
feature requests, or any other feedback.

![flaming fingers spell demonstration](sulis-battle.png)

Features:

- Cross platform native binaries, currently [built for Windows and Linux][sulis-releases]
- Multiple campaigns with over 8 hours of playtime,
  featuring both handcrafted and procedural content.
- A detailed and fully realized world and story - check out
  the [Lore page][sulis-lore].
- Designed with modding in mind - although more work still needs
  to be done in this area.
- A powerful 2D graphics engine with zoom, scalable UI, HiDPI support,
  and a swappable graphics backend.
- Runs on very modest hardware - even software renderers
  (although at a reduced frame rate).

![ability tree gui](sulis-abilities-tree.png)

The GPLv3-licensed [source code is hosted on GitHub][sulis-src].
Sulis is written in Rust, with scripting in Lua and most data files in the YAML format.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Bumpy terrain with a rivers and trees](veloren.png)

[Veloren][veloren] is an open-world, open-source multiplayer voxel RPG.
The game is in an early stage of development, but is playable.

This month [a v0.4 version was released](https://veloren.net/devblog-37)
and a [player survey results was published][veloren-survey].

Some of October's improvements:

- lots of bugfixes and optimizations;
- improved erosion, rivers and water flow physics;
- user interface improvements;
- improved game lore;
- RFC procedure for 0.5 development.

### [Canon Collision][canon-collision]

![Exported models with textureas and skeletal animations](pf-sandbox.jpg)

[Canon Collision][canon-collision] by [@rukai] is an Undertale + Homestuck
fan-made platform fighter with powerful tools for modding.
It was forked from another project of rukai's
[PF Sandbox](https://github.com/rukai/PF_Sandbox) so he could focus on making
a game rather then an engine.

This month,
[exporting and hot-reloading assets from blender](https://twitter.com/thisIsRukai/status/1180477120113340417),

### [Antorum][antorum]

![Antorum screenshot: a few human characters, a few rats and an inventory UI](antorum.jpeg)

[Antorum][antorum] is a multiplayer RPG where players build their characters
and fight against the growing threats on the isle.
The game server is authoritative and written in Rust,
while the client is written in Unity/C#.

This month, [@dooskington] published a bunch of devlogs:

- [#6 "Items And Inventory"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/6);
- [#7 "Grubbnet"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/7);
- [#8 "The Editor"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/8);
- [#9 "The Editor, Pt. 2"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/9);
- [#10 "Terrain Sync"](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/10).

------

As described in the [7th devlog](https://dooskington.com/dev-log/7),
an initial version of a "[grubbnet]" crate was published.

It's a lightweight TCP client/server
for writing networked applications and games.
It abstracts socket code, keeps track of connections,
and delivers everything back to the developer in a nice list of events.
In addition to handling network events
(such as client connects and disconnects),
handling incoming packets is as easy as grabbing an iterator
over the incoming packet queue.

It's the same networking crate that the Antorum game server uses
under the hood.

### [Ferris Fencing][ferris-fencing]

![Two crabs fencing on a 1D map](ferris-fencing.png)

[Ferris Fencing][ferris-fencing] is a live tournament in which
player-programmed bots combat each other on a [RISC-V] virtual machine.
It is a showcase of [CKB-VM], a simple implementation of the RISC-V instruction set,
written in the Rust programming language.

[Here're the rules][ferris-fencing-rules].

The Ferris Fencing tournament is not yet live,
but fencers may begin building their bots and testing them locally.

### [Will it dissolve?][dissolve]

![Dissolve gameplay demo](dissolve.gif)

["Will it dissolve?"][dissolve] is a small puzzle game
for ["Open Jam 2019"](http://openjam.io)
where you have to prepare the level so that it will
automatically convert and dissolve in the future.

Programmed with the help of the [Tetra engine][tetra].
[The source code is available here][dissolve-src].

### [Garden Devlog: October][garden-october]

![Garden screenshot: a tree, leaves, water and ruins](garden.jpeg)

[Garden][garden-itch] is an upcoming game centered around
growing realistic plants.

The following changes were made since the last devlog:

- Improved flowers were added.
- The plant simulation code is almost finalized,
  and developers will be able to start adding new species soon.
- The procedural ruin generation was improved:
  no more floating concrete chunks.

[Watch the video demo here](https://twitter.com/logicsoup/status/1190754460575961089).

Also, a new design plan was created:

- The main objective is to restore the luscious ecosystem
  in a polluted wasteland.
  The player will have to continuously figure out how to handle different
  environmental constraints to keep trees growing, collect enough fruit
  and figure out what to do with them, and unlock new goals and flora.
- But for players who are interested in wild, goalless plant growth,
  there‚Äôll also be a sandbox mode.
  As one progresses in the main game and ‚Äúunlocks‚Äù more trees,
  playing around with creating flourishing jungle troves will be possible.

## Library & Tooling updates

### [Dev Time Optimization -- Part 1 (1.9x speedup, 65% less disk usage)][dev-time-opt]

Compile times (full and incremental) are one of Rust's pain points.
[Azriel] published a devlog about optimizing [Will]'s build times.
Summary:

> In a 45k LOC / 102-crate workspace,
> moving tests from member crates into a single workspace_tests crate
> achieved the following improvements:
>
> - Build and test duration in release mode reduced
>   from 23 minutes to 13 minutes.
> - Debug artifact disk usage reduced from 20 G to 7 G
>   (65% reduction, fresh build),
>   or 230 G to 50 G (78% reduction, ongoing development).

### üõà Tip: Speed Up Iteration Time By Using [LLD Linker][lld]

Takeaways from [an interesting tweet](https://twitter.com/VladZhukov0/status/1186412587958845442)
from [VladZhukov0]
and a [/r/rust thread "Is the rust compiler really THAT slow?"][r_rust_slow]:

- Try switching to [LLD linker][lld]:

  ```sh
  RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld" cargo run
  # Alternatively, you can set `rustflags` in your `.cargo/config`
  ```

  Depending on your project structure, OS, and toolchain
  this can potentially speed up the incremental compilation a few times.

- Also, try disabling debug information (if you don't need it):

  ```toml
  # in your `Cargo.toml`

  [profile.dev]
  debug = 0
  ```

> Now the linking only takes around one second,
> compared to 10 seconds previously.
>
> Reduced my average compilation time from 10-20s
> (which is a bit crazyness for gamedev iteration) to 5-7s.
> Wonder why haven't I tried this before?ü§î

### [RLSL][rlsl]: a Rust to SPIR-V Compiler

![RLSL code sample](rlsl-example.png)

^ _a simple fragment shader that renders a red circle (temporary syntax)_

This month, [@MaikKlein_DEV] gave a talk at
[The Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org)'s meetup in Munich
about bringing Rust to the GPU:
[here're the slides][rlsl-slides].

[RLSL][rlsl] (Rust Like Shading Language) is an _experimental_ project
that allows compiling Rust to [SPIR-V][spir-v].

Current features:

- Supports cargo;
- Multiple entry points can be defined in the same SPIR-V module;
- Currently supports Vertex, Fragment and Compute shaders;
- Shader code can run on the CPU because rlsl is a subset of Rust.

Also, check out older posts:

![a spline sample with node handles](splines.png)

[splines], a crate by [@phaazon] to handle spline interpolation,
[just got released in version 3.0.0][splines-v3].

That version adds support for stroke B√©zier interpolation,
which is a B√©zier interpolation but allows you to break the handles
(instead of the regular 180¬∞ angle formed
by the handle with the `Interpolation::Bezier` mode).

[spline-editor] got a patch to allows you to try stroke B√©zier.

### [ultraviolet]

![ultraviolet benchmarks table](ultraviolet-benches.png)

[ultraviolet] by [@fu5ha] is a crate to do basic, computer-graphics-related,
linear algebra, but fast, by taking full advantage of [SIMD].

> <...> To do this, it uses an "SoA" ([Structure of Arrays][aos_soa])
> architecture such that each Wec (wide-vec) actually contains the data
> for 4 Vecs and will do any operation on all 4 of the vector 'lanes'
> at the same time.
> Doing this is potentially much (factor of 10) faster than
> an "AoS" ([Array of Structs][aos_soa]) layout,
> as all current Rust linear algebra libraries do, depending on your work load.
> However, algorithms must be carefully architected
> to take full advantage of this, and doing so can be easier said than done,
> especially if your algorithm involves significant branching.

### [This month in rustsim #8 (Aug - Sep - Oct 2019)][rustsim-8]

![salva's logo](salva.png)

Main updates:

- [salva.rs] - two new crates for fluid simulation: salva2d and salva3d!

  > Salva is a new project dedicated to fluid simulation.
  > The goal of salva is to provide CPU-based, particle-based, 2D and 3D,
  > fluid simulation libraries that can be used for interactive and offline
  > application like animation.
  > It could be used, to some extents, for video games (especially the 2D version),
  > as long as the number of particles is kept small.

  Watch a ["Fluid simulation with salva 0.1 and nphysics 0.13"][rustsim-video]
  video or play with the online [2D][salva-demo-2d] or [3D][salva-demo-3d]
  WASM demos yourself.

- [nphysics 0.13][nphysics.rs] brings:
  some support of breakable joint constraints,
  and more improvements on the integration with ECS.

- [@sebcrozet](https://github.com/sebcrozet)
  (the main developer of all the current rustsim projects)
  [have been added to the GitHub sponsor beta](https://github.com/sponsors/sebcrozet).

### [Cynic64's WIP Rendering Engine][cynic64-ann]

[@cynic64] shared a [demo video][cynic64-video] and
a [report about their WIP rendering engine][cynic64-ann].

It's based on Vulkano and consists of three repos:

- [re-ll] - low level abstractions for Vulkano's command buffers and windows.
- [render-engine] - Vulkan abstraction.
- [test-render-engine] - various little programs created with render-engine.
  "pretty" is the one shown in the video, "base" shows the basic functionality.

[!["Doors" demo](rogulike-demo.gif)][doors-demo]

[The Roguelike Tutorial][roguelike-book] by [@blackfuture]
includes almost 40 chapters now and continues to grow.

Some of the October's updates:

- traps and doors;
- mapgen algorithms including Waveform Collapse;
- prefab levels and sections;
- guided procgen for towns.

All chapters have links to WASM demos.

------

Also, 0.5 version of [rltk-rs] brings
abstraction between back-ends, better compile time,
web version improvements, and more examples.

### [Nannou awarded Mozilla grant for foundational audio development][nannou-post]

[![Nannou & mozilla logos](mission_partners_nannou_mozilla.png)][nannou-post]

[Nannou][nannou] is a creative coding framework that aims to make it easy
for artists to express themselves with simple, fast, reliable code.

[Nannou has been awarded 10K USD in funding][nannou-post]
as a part of the [MOSS Mission Partners] track.
The proposed work is aimed towards improving the state
of some foundational crates within the Rust audio ecosystem
over the next three to four months.

Key areas of our work will include:

- Addressing some long-standing issues in [CPAL].
- Review and improve CPAL's web audio support.
- Implement a simple web app and guide demonstrating CPAL's web audio support.
- Design, develop and document a standard audio graph abstraction and crate,
  reflecting on lessons learned and limitations of prior efforts,
  and the requirements of the wider rust audio community.
