Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### FBSim

![FBSim initial version](fbsim.png)
_FBSim running with default agents._

[FBSim] by [Ian Tayler] is a football/soccer game where you program the
players using Rust and try to beat a team controlled by another AI.

You can follow the [tutorial] for implementing your own simple AI for FBSim,
or you can look at the code directly, which can be found on the
[github repo](FBSim). FBSim is at an early stage of development so issues and
comments are welcome!
