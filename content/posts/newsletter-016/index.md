## Learning Material Updates

### [ECS scheduler thoughts, part 1]

[@Ratys] wrote an article about system schedulers in [ECS]. It contains
an overview of the scheduling problem itself, covers the constraints a solution
to it should consider, and dissects schedulers of [Bevy] engine and [`yaks`] as
examples.

### [Chess game in Rust using Bevy]

![Tutorial result](bevy_chess.gif)
_Chess gameplay_

[@guimcaballero] published a tutorial on using Bevy 0.3 to make a Chess clone in
3d. Most of the concepts are explained along the way, from how to load meshes to
how to select pieces and board squares, using [bevy_mod_picking].

### [Learn Wgpu][learn-wgpu]

Development of new tutorial content has slowed down due to wgpu still being in
development. [@sotrh] has committed to continue maintaining the project through
the comming version changes, and plans to add more new content when the API
solidifies. He with the help of other contributors such as GitHub user
[@kanerogers] worked through a series of issues to polish the repository before
the content freeze.
In addition to that he added a [compute pipeline showcase][learn-wgpu-compute]
and an [imgui showcase][learn-wgpu-imgui].

In other news @sotrh has started a [Patreon][@sotrh] to help fund research
and development on the Learn Wgpu site as well as other wgpu related projects.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [profiling]

This month, [profiling] was released on crates.io. This crate provides a very
thin abstraction over instrumented profiling crates like `puffin`, `optick`,
`tracy`, and `superluminal-perf`.

Mark up your code like this:

```rust
#[profiling::function]
fn some_function() {
    burn_time(5);

    for i in 0..5 {
        profiling::scope!("Looped Operation");
        burn_time(1);
    }
}
```

And get visualizations like this (`optick` and `puffin` shown):

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

It has a handful of features that make it stand out:

- No schema restrictions
- HashMap support out of the box
- Trait object support through the [`rkyv_dyn`] crate
- Validation through the [`bytecheck`] crate, suitable for untrusted and
potentially malicious data
- Safe mutable archives with pinning

Reddit user [vlmutolo] also made a [toy benchmark] comparing rkyv against serde
and bincode and found that rkyv had promising initial numbers:

```text
serialize (bincode):    89 ns/iter
serialize (rkyv):       86 ns/iter

deserialize (bincode):  118 ns/iter
deserialize (rkyv):     16 ns/iter
```

A write-up on the [architecture and internals of rkyv] is also available.

### [rib]

![rib](rib.gif)

Parsing a 3D model file and understanding the different links between bone
matrices, keyframes and vertices is a task that can take a lot of time and
motivation of the developer. On top of that, combining the different bone
transform matrices for the current frame is often error prone.

[rib] is an attempt to tackle these problems and might help you save time.
Current features of [rib] include:

- Support of collada files coming from the latest Blender version.
- Precomputation of the bone matrices expressed in the world space so that you
  just have to pass it to your shader for traditional GPU skinning.
- Interpolation between keyframes
- (De)/serialization in binary thanks to [bincode]

[rib] can be greatly extended, for example with the support of other format
handling skeleton data, such as the [glTF] format.
Contributions are more than welcome.

### [Kira]

[Kira] by [@tesselode] is an audio library designed to help create expressive
audio for games. It aims to fill the holes in many game engines' built-in audio
APIs with features for creating seamless music loops and scripting audio events.

v0.2.0 is coming out soon with an Arrangements feature for creating complex pieces
out of individual sounds, tween easing, panning support, and workflow improvements.

### [gfx-rs] and [wgpu]

![gfx-picture](wgpu-big-picture.svg)

The gfx-rs team has published a post ["The Big Picture"][gfx-post] providing
the overview of all projects in the works, and how they are connected to each other.

[wgpu] has moved from [gfx-extras] to the new [gpu-alloc] and [gpu-descriptor]
libraries by [@zakarumych]. These are backend-agnostic, which allows `wgpu`
to now depend on `gfx-hal` directly without intermediates. Patching [gfx-rs]
will now be easier, without the need to release every little change.

Finally, all the latest [wgpu] code has landed into Gecko, and new
features and fixes are implemented in Firefox. That allows it to run
most of the updated [WebGPU samples][wgpu-samples].

### [KAS] v0.6 and [KAS-text] v0.2

![KAS markdown](kas-markdown.png)
_Markdown parsing demo_

[KAS] by [@dhardy] is a general purpose UI toolkit; its
initial aim is "old school" desktop apps with good keyboard and touchscreen
support. Unlike many modern immediate-mode UIs, KAS's widgets retain state,
allowing minimal per-frame updates. KAS supports embedded WebGPU graphics now,
and plans to support embedded usage and additional rendering systems.

[KAS-text] v0.2 saw a significant revision to its API, including support for
rich text (bold, italic, underline, size and some layout improvements).
[KAS] v0.6 pulls in those changes and adds a few fixes and QoL improvements.

### [bevmnist][bevmnist-itch.io]

![demo of running inferences for all digits](bevmnist.gif)
_Running through all digits_

[bevmnist][bevmnist-itch.io] by [@FrancoisMockers] is a PoC for running
inferences from a neural network in a game made with [bevy], that can run in
WASM (source code on [github][bevmnist-github]).

Using [tract], the goal was to test running neural network inferences from a
game. [MNIST handwritten digits classification][MNIST] is the "hello world" of
neural networks, and has small enough networks available in [onnx] format that
can run in real time in WASM. This project also has github actions that will
build and release a [bevy] game to itch.io for Linux, macOS, Windows and WASM.
