## Learning Material Updates

### [Hands-on Rust][hands-on-rust]

[![Hands-On Rust](hands-on-rust.jpg)][hands-on-rust]

["Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play"][hands-on-rust]
by Herbert Wolverson is now in beta. The book teaches Rust through game development
examples, and is targeted at readers who have some experience with writing code
in other languages. It teaches beginner to intermediate-level Rust. It also teaches
high-level gamedev concepts, notably Entity-Component System (ECS) theory.

After walking you through installing Rust, a few simple examples teach the language
basics. Then you put these together to make "Flappy Dragon" - a simple Flappy Bird
clone. The book then changes gear and begins to build a dungeon crawler (roguelike)
with tile graphics. The first beta walks you through the basics, "Flappy Dragon"
and making an ECS-based dungeon crawler skeleton - focused on teaching basic Rust,
ECS composition and control flow. Beta 2 added health, a heads-up display, combat
and win/lose conditions - focused on making the user comfortable with Rust's
amazing iterator system. Beta 3 will add fields-of-view, more dungeon designs and
map theming - focused on teaching trait use and creation.

Beta 1 launched November 11th, Beta 2 launched November 25th. The next beta is
expected December 8th.

### [ECS scheduler thoughts, part 1]

[@Ratys] wrote an article about system schedulers in [ECS]. It contains
an overview of the scheduling problem itself, covers the constraints a solution
to it should consider, and dissects schedulers of [Bevy] engine and [`yaks`] as
examples.

### [Chess game in Rust using Bevy]

![Tutorial result](bevy_chess.gif)
_Chess gameplay_

[@guimcaballero] published a tutorial on using Bevy 0.3 to make a Chess clone in
3d. Most of the concepts are explained along the way, from how to load meshes to
how to select pieces and board squares, using [bevy_mod_picking].

### [Learn Wgpu][learn-wgpu]

Development of new tutorial content has slowed down due to wgpu still being in
development. [@sotrh] has committed to continue maintaining the project through
the comming version changes, and plans to add more new content when the API
solidifies. He with the help of other contributors such as GitHub user
[@kanerogers] worked through a series of issues to polish the repository before
the content freeze.
In addition to that he added a [compute pipeline showcase][learn-wgpu-compute]
and an [imgui showcase][learn-wgpu-imgui].

In other news @sotrh has started a [Patreon][@sotrh] to help fund research
and development on the Learn Wgpu site as well as other wgpu related projects.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [cargo-mobile]

[![Bevy's Breakout example running on an iPhone XR](cargo-mobile.jpg)][cargo-mobile]
_Bevy's Breakout example running on an iPhone XR_

[cargo-mobile] is a tool created by [Brainium Studios] to simplify Rust mobile
development. It generates Xcode and Android Studio projects, and provides handy
commands for building and deploying apps to iOS and Android devices.

### [profiling]

This month, [profiling] was released on crates.io. This crate provides a very
thin abstraction over instrumented profiling crates like `puffin`, `optick`,
`tracy`, and `superluminal-perf`.

Mark up your code like this:

```rust
#[profiling::function]
fn some_function() {
    burn_time(5);

    for i in 0..5 {
        profiling::scope!("Looped Operation");
        burn_time(1);
    }
}
```

And get visualizations like this (`optick` and `puffin` shown):

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

It has a handful of features that make it stand out:

- No schema restrictions
- HashMap support out of the box
- Trait object support through the [`rkyv_dyn`] crate
- Validation through the [`bytecheck`] crate, suitable for untrusted and
potentially malicious data
- Safe mutable archives with pinning

Reddit user [vlmutolo] also made a [toy benchmark] comparing rkyv against serde
and bincode and found that rkyv had promising initial numbers:

```text
serialize (bincode):    89 ns/iter
serialize (rkyv):       86 ns/iter

deserialize (bincode):  118 ns/iter
deserialize (rkyv):     16 ns/iter
```

A write-up on the [architecture and internals of rkyv] is also available.

### [assets_manager] v0.4

[assets_manager] provides an convenient way to work with external files, making
ressources caching and hot-reloading easy and straightforward.

This month was released version 0.4.0, bringing loads of improvements.

- A `Source` trait, to load assets from anywhere. It makes the crate usable in
  WebAssembly.
- Assets that can load other assets, with a transparent integration with
  hot-reloading. Using a manifest file has never been so easy !
- Improved perfomances
- See the [full changelog][assets_manager_log] for more informations.

### [rib]

![rib](rib.gif)

Parsing a 3D model file and understanding the different links between bone
matrices, keyframes and vertices is a task that can take a lot of time and
motivation of the developer. On top of that, combining the different bone
transform matrices for the current frame is often error prone.

[rib] is an attempt to tackle these problems and might help you save time.
Current features of [rib] include:

- Support of collada files coming from the latest Blender version.
- Precomputation of the bone matrices expressed in the world space so that you
  just have to pass it to your shader for traditional GPU skinning.
- Interpolation between keyframes
- (De)/serialization in binary thanks to [bincode]

[rib] can be greatly extended, for example with the support of other format
handling skeleton data, such as the [glTF] format.
Contributions are more than welcome.

### [Kira]

[Kira] by [@tesselode] is an audio library designed to help create expressive
audio for games. It aims to fill the holes in many game engines' built-in audio
APIs with features for creating seamless music loops and scripting audio events.

v0.2.0 is coming out soon with an Arrangements feature for creating complex pieces
out of individual sounds, tween easing, panning support, and workflow improvements.

### [gfx-rs] and [wgpu]

![gfx-picture](wgpu-big-picture.svg)

The gfx-rs team has published a post ["The Big Picture"][gfx-post] providing
the overview of all projects in the works, and how they are connected to each other.

[wgpu] has moved from [gfx-extras] to the new [gpu-alloc] and [gpu-descriptor]
libraries by [@zakarumych]. These are backend-agnostic, which allows `wgpu`
to now depend on `gfx-hal` directly without intermediates. Patching [gfx-rs]
will now be easier, without the need to release every little change.

Finally, all the latest [wgpu] code has landed into Gecko, and new
features and fixes are implemented in Firefox. That allows it to run
most of the updated [WebGPU samples][wgpu-samples].

### [KAS] v0.6 and [KAS-text] v0.2

![KAS markdown](kas-markdown.png)
_Markdown parsing demo_

[KAS] by [@dhardy] is a general purpose UI toolkit; its
initial aim is "old school" desktop apps with good keyboard and touchscreen
support. Unlike many modern immediate-mode UIs, KAS's widgets retain state,
allowing minimal per-frame updates. KAS supports embedded WebGPU graphics now,
and plans to support embedded usage and additional rendering systems.

[KAS-text] v0.2 saw a significant revision to its API, including support for
rich text (bold, italic, underline, size and some layout improvements).
[KAS] v0.6 pulls in those changes and adds a few fixes and QoL improvements.

The goal of [Dotrix] is to become a 3D engine for the new RPG project. The
engine is free and open source, delivering a set of common high-level features
like skeletal animation, skybox, terrain, camera controlling, input mapping and
many others. It is built on top of the
[wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/) with an ECS core which is a part of
the engine.

Currently supported features:

- Linear ECS with systems as simple functions, that can have optional context
- Import of textures from PNG files
- Import of multiple assets from GLTF files (textures, meshes, skins and
animations)
- FPS and delta time counters
- Rendering of meshes and simple scenes with light and camera controls
- Rendering of skeletal animations
- 3 showcase demo applications

### [ggez]

![lot's of overlapping bunnies](ggez-bun.png)
_ggez bunnymark - 60,000 buns at 60 FPS_

[ggez] is a 2D game framework inspired by Love2D. The project is chugging
along getting everything prepared for a 0.6 release at the end of 2020,
and a lot of work has been done in the last month:

- All major dependencies have been updated, including a long-overdue
  update to `winit` 0.23.
- Over a dozen pull requests have been merged, large and small.
- A bunch of old issues have been cleaned up.

Major features to look forward to include far better math performance, a
`MeshBatch` type, better ergonomics on Linux Wayland, and more. There's
lots of work still to be done though. A bunch of issues are out of date
and need triage, docs need to be proofread, and especially examples need
be updated and tested on every platform imaginable. Try out the `devel`

[![a scene with lightning and multiple hi-poly character models](rg3d_instancing.jpg)][rg3d_twit]

[rg3d] is a game engine that aims to be easy to use and provide large set
of out-of-box features. Some of the recent updates:

- Migrated to nalgebra from custom linear algebra.
- Replaced custom physics engine with Rapier.
- Implemented sound backend for macOS.
- Environment mapping - now objects can have reflections.
- Implemented geometry instancing - now you can render tons of objects with
low overhead.
- Performance improvements.
- Added [gobo] for spot lights.
- Added CPU lightmapper - it is possible now to "bake" static lighting
into a texture to improve performance.
- Lots of other bugfixes and improvements.

### [bevmnist][bevmnist-itch.io]

_Running through all digits_

[bevmnist][bevmnist-itch.io] by [@FrancoisMockers] is a PoC for running
inferences from a neural network in a game made with [bevy], that can run in
WASM (source code on [github][bevmnist-github]).

Using [tract], the goal was to test running neural network inferences from a
game. [MNIST handwritten digits classification][MNIST] is the "hello world" of
neural networks, and has small enough networks available in [onnx] format that
can run in real time in WASM. This project also has github actions that will
build and release a [bevy] game to itch.io for Linux, macOS, Windows and WASM.
