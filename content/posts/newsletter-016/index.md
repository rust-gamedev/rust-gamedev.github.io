Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

## Learning Material Updates

### Learn Wgpu News

Development of new tutorial content has slowed down due to wgpu still being in development. @sotrh has committed to continue maintaining the project through the comming version changes, and plans to add more new content when the API solidifies. He with the help of other contributors such as GitHub user @kanerogers worked through a series of issues to polish the repository before the content freeze. In addition to that he added a [compute pipeline showcase](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/showcase/compute/#possible-improvements) and an [imgui showcase](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/showcase/imgui-demo/).

In other news @sotrh has started a [patreon](https://patreon.com/sotrh) to help fund research and development on the Learn Wgpu site as well as other wgpu related projects.

You can learn more [on the Learn Wgpu news page](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/news/#november-2020-cleanup-content-freeze-and-patreon)
