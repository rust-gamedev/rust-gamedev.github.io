Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [rib]

![rib](rib.gif)

Parsing a 3D model file and understand the different links between bone matrices,
keyframes and vertices is a task that can take a lot of time and motivation of
the developer. On top of that, combining the different bone transform matrices
for the current frame is often error prone.

[rib] is an attempt to tackle these problems and might help you save time.
Current features of [rib] include:

- Support of collada files coming from the latest Blender version.
- Precomputation of the bone matrices expressed in the world space so that you
  just have to pass it to your shader for traditional GPU skinning.
- Interpolation between keyframes
- (De)/serialization in binary thanks to [bincode]

[rib] can be greatly extended, for example with the support of other format
handling skeleton data, such as the [glTF] format.
Contributions are more than welcome.
