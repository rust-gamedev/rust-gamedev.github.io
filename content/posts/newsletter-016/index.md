Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Last Call for [Rust GameDev Survey][survey]

Our annual [Rust Game Development Ecosystem Survey][survey] will be closed
on Sunday at the end of this week, 6. December 2020.
It'll only take 10 minutes, and your responses help us
better understand the state of our ecosystem and where we
should try to focus our collective efforts.

## Game Updates

### [A/B Street][abstreet]

![15 minute tool](abstreet.png)

[A/B Street][abstreet] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small changes
to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers. Any city
with OpenStreetMap coverage can be used!

Some of this month's updates:

- started a new tool to explore 15-minute neighborhoods;
- simpler process for [importing new cities][abstreet-new-cities];
- large internal refactoring for the GUI and initializing the simulation;

### FBSim

![FBSim initial version](fbsim.png)
_FBSim running with default agents._

[FBSim] by [Ian Tayler] is a football/soccer game where you program the
players using Rust and try to beat a team controlled by another AI.

You can follow the [tutorial] for implementing your own simple AI for FBSim,
or you can look at the code directly, which can be found on the
[github repo]. FBSim is at an early stage of development so issues and
comments are welcome!

## Learning Material Updates

### [Chess game in Rust using Bevy]

![Tutorial result](bevy_chess.gif)
_Chess gameplay_

[@guimcaballero] published a tutorial on using Bevy 0.3 to make a Chess clone in
3d. Most of the concepts are explained along the way, from how to load meshes to
how to select pieces and board squares, using [bevy_mod_picking].

### [Learn Wgpu][learn-wgpu]

Development of new tutorial content has slowed down due to wgpu still being in
development. [@sotrh] has committed to continue maintaining the project through
the comming version changes, and plans to add more new content when the API
solidifies. He with the help of other contributors such as GitHub user
[@kanerogers] worked through a series of issues to polish the repository before
the content freeze.
In addition to that he added a [compute pipeline showcase][learn-wgpu-compute]
and an [imgui showcase][learn-wgpu-imgui].

In other news @sotrh has started a [Patreon][@sotrh] to help fund research
and development on the Learn Wgpu site as well as other wgpu related projects.

You can learn more [on the Learn Wgpu news page][learn-wgpu-news].

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [profiling]

This month, [profiling] was released on crates.io. This crate provides a very
thin abstraction over instrumented profiling crates like `puffin`, `optick`,
`tracy`, and `superluminal-perf`.

Mark up your code like this:

```rust
#[profiling::function]
fn some_function() {
    burn_time(5);

    for i in 0..5 {
        profiling::scope!("Looped Operation");
        burn_time(1);
    }
}
```

And get visualizations like this (`optick` and `puffin` shown):

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

It has a handful of features that make it stand out:

- No schema restrictions
- HashMap support out of the box
- Trait object support through the [`rkyv_dyn`] crate
- Validation through the [`bytecheck`] crate, suitable for untrusted and
potentially malicious data
- Safe mutable archives with pinning

Reddit user [vlmutolo] also made a [toy benchmark] comparing rkyv against serde
and bincode and found that rkyv had promising initial numbers:

```text
serialize (bincode):    89 ns/iter
serialize (rkyv):       86 ns/iter

deserialize (bincode):  118 ns/iter
deserialize (rkyv):     16 ns/iter
```

A write-up on the [architecture and internals of rkyv] is also available.

### [gfx-rs] and [wgpu]

![gfx-picture](wgpu-big-picture.svg)

The gfx-rs team has published a post ["The Big Picture"][gfx-post] providing
the overview of all projects in the works, and how they are connected to each other.

[wgpu] has moved from [gfx-extras] to the new [gpu-alloc] and [gpu-descriptor]
libraries by [@zakarumych]. These are backend-agnostic, which allows `wgpu`
to now depend on `gfx-hal` directly without intermediates. Patching [gfx-rs]
will now be easier, without the need to release every little change.

Finally, all the latest [wgpu] code has landed into Gecko, and new
features and fixes are implemented in Firefox. That allows it to run
most of the updated [WebGPU samples][wgpu-samples].

### [KAS] v0.6 and [KAS-text] v0.2

![KAS markdown](kas-markdown.png)
_Markdown parsing demo_

[KAS] by [@dhardy] is a general purpose UI toolkit; its
initial aim is "old school" desktop apps with good keyboard and touchscreen
support. Unlike many modern immediate-mode UIs, KAS's widgets retain state,
allowing minimal per-frame updates. KAS supports embedded WebGPU graphics now,
and plans to support embedded usage and additional rendering systems.

[KAS-text] v0.2 saw a significant revision to its API, including support for
rich text (bold, italic, underline, size and some layout improvements).
[KAS] v0.6 pulls in those changes and adds a few fixes and QoL improvements.

### [Tetra]

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA and Raylib. This month,
versions 0.5.3 and 0.5.4 were released, with some frequently requested features:

- A `Mesh` API, allowing users to create arbitary 2D geometry
- Experimental support for high-DPI rendering

There has also been numerous bug fixes and documentation improvements. For full
details and a list of breaking changes, see the [changelog][tetra-changelog].

### [ogmo3]

[ogmo3] is a Rust crate for parsing projects and levels created with
[Ogmo Editor 3]. This month, version 0.1 was released, adding serialization
support, and helper methods for unpacking layer data. The [sample code][ogmo3-sample]
has also been updated to show the new helpers in action.
