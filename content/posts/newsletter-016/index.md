Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Hands-On Rust][HandsOnRust]

![Hands-On Rust](hands_on_rust.jpg)

*Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play* by Herbert Wolverson is now in beta. The book teaches Rust through game development examples, and is targeted at readers who have some experience with writing code in other languages. It teaches beginner to intermediate-level Rust. It also teaches high-level gamedev concepts, notably Entity-Component System (ECS) theory.

After walking you through installing Rust, a few simple examples teach the language basics. Then you put these together to make *Flappy Dragon* - a simple Flappy Bird clone. The book then changes gear and begins to build a dungeon crawler (roguelike) with tile graphics. The first beta walks you through the basics, *Flappy Dragon* and making an ECS-based dungeon crawler skeleton - focused on teaching basic Rust, ECS composition and control flow. Beta 2 added health, a heads-up display, combat and win/lose conditions - focused on making the user comfortable with Rust's amazing iterator system. Beta 3 will add fields-of-view, more dungeon designs and map theming - focused on teaching trait use and creation.

Beta 1 launched November 11th, Beta 2 launched November 25th. The next beta is expected December 8th.
