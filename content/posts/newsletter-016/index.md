Welcome to the 16th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Space Shooter]

![space_shooter_rs gameplay](space_shooter_12-03-2020.gif)

The [Space Shooter] project is a game in development by [Carlo Supina] and
[Micah Tigley]. It is a 2D "shoot-em-up" game that takes place in space and is
inspired by games like [Raiden] and [Binding of Isaac].

Exciting new additions have been made in November!

- Micah added a ["paused" text overlay] to provide visual indication for when
the game is paused

- Carlo added a [new armor system] that gives a chance for destroyed enemies to
drop armor consumables that can block a single hit from any damage source

- Work on a new [Missile Launcher enemy] has begun!
