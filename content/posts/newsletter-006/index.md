Welcome to the sixth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.

[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.

We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[Jake Shadle], a veteran of DICE/Frostbite,
was interviewed at [RustFest 2019] by the [Rustacean Station] podcast
on using Rust for game development at Embark Studios.
Topics/timestamps:

- \[01:25] What is yours (and Embark’s) background in game development?
- \[02:14] What is the relevance of the Frostbite engine
  and what is your experience with it?
- \[04:15] What makes you think that Rust as a language is suitable
  for game development?
- \[06:13] How is parallelism employed in a game engine
  on the scale of Frostbite?
- \[07:07] Where is the Rust library ecosystem lacking for your use case,
  and what crates are you making use of?
- \[11:13] Why is Embark interested in WebAssembly?
- \[14:20] How can someone get in touch or learn more about Embark?

![Sitting on the edge](veloren2.png)

In February, the developers hope to push forward to 0.6
with a strong intro meeting.
Authentication is slated to be released, as well as the Airshipper GUI beta.
Hopefully, we also see controller support and improvements
to the sound system as well.

### [Physically Based Temperature Simulation For Games][temperature-simulation]

![Dwarfs, cow and campfire demo](dwarfs.gif)

[Alexandru Ene] is working on a dwarf colony management game.
This month, a
["Physically Based Temperature Simulation For Games"][temperature-simulation]
devlog was released:
how to adapt real-world thermodynamics formulas to a game
and why you may want to do it?

### [Micro Entertainment Pack][micro-pack]

![itch collection of 12 games](micro-entertainment-pack.png)

[Micro Entertainment Pack][micro-pack] is a collection of 12 tiny desktop games
by [Liam O'Connor].

> I like to watch terrible TV shows on my computer,
> but often they tend to drag so I like to have something else to do
> at the same time.
> Thus, I developed the Micro Entertainment Pack --- fun casual games
> that fit in a fraction of your screen real estate.
> These games are inspired mostly by the Microsoft Plus! Entertainment packs
> for Windows, but I am also throwing in some other
> enjoyable titles from my days as a classic mac user.

All games in the pack are made using Liam's [tesserae] library for graphics composed
out of 8x8 2 colour tiles.
All graphics were drawn using the tesseraed editor that comes with the library.
All games use a common tileset to do all of their graphical drawing.

[The source code for all games is available here.][micro-pack-src]

### [Scale][scale]

![Society scales](scales.png)

[Scale][scale] is a new open-source project about modern day society simulation
from the bottom-up.

> Each individual has its own thought model, meaning every action
> has its importance and influences the environment.
> Scale is not a video game, but rather a live artwork.
> The world itself won't be generated or created by the user
> but is part of the project.
> That way, the focus is on the world itself and not on the tools to build it.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### Rust 1.41: [Profile Overrides][overrides] are Stable Now!

![Rust 1.41](rust-1-41.png)

Though it wasn't mentioned in [the official announcement post][rust-1-41],
Rust 1.41 brings a cargo feature
that many gamedevs have been waiting a long time for:
[profile overrides][overrides].

This feature allows you to:

- Use optimized deps in debug build to reduce incremental build time
  and get a sane FPS.

  > To override the settings for all dependencies
  > (but not any workspace member), use the "*" package name:
  >
  > ```toml
  > [profile.dev.package."*"]
  > opt-level = 2
  > ```

- Do not optimize build-dependencies (like `syn`) to increase
  full release build time:

  ```toml
  [profile.release.build-override]
  opt-level = 0
  ```

[@MontyPatrick] shared their initial experience of diving into Rust GameDev
in the ["Adventuring into the World of Games in Rust"][gamedev-rust] blog post.

> Overall, while things are still relatively new in developing games in Rust
> I believe that Rust can serve as a great alternative
> to languages such as C++ in the field of game development.

### [Translating Quake 3 into Rust][q3-rust]

![Rusty Q3 main menu](q3.jpeg)

[Immunant] published an article ["Translating Quake 3 into Rust"][q3-rust]:

> The Rust-loving team at [Immunant] has been hard at work on [C2Rust][c2rust],
> a migration framework that takes the drudgery out of migrating to Rust.
> Our goal is to make safety improvements to the translated Rust automatically
> where we can, and help the programmer do the same where we cannot.
> First, however, we have to build a rock-solid translator that gets
> people up and running in Rust.
> Testing on small CLI programs gets old eventually, so we decided
> to try translating Quake 3 into Rust.
> After a couple of days, we were likely the first people to ever play

### [Optimath]

[Optimath] by [@djugei]
is an experimental const generics based linear algebra library
that works without any allocations in no_std and utilizes SIMD.
_Requires nightly toolchain._

Project goals:

> Besides being hopefully useful as a library it is also
> an exploration of rusts newer advanced type system features.
> It is therefore an explicit goal to provide feedback
> to the developers of those features.
> [The `insights` module][optimath-insights] contains some of that.
>
> It is also meant to explore the design space
> of Linear Algebra libraries that utilize those features.
> As such it may serve as inspiration for how bigger linalg libraries
> might adopt them.

Features:

- Several [easing functions][easings], including user-defined Bézier curves
  and keyframable curves;
- Animation sequences;
- [mint] integration for 2D/3D/4D support (points, rectangles, colors, etc)

Animation sequences example:

```rust
use keyframe::{keyframes, Keyframe, AnimationSequence};

fn example() {
    // (value, time) or (value, time, function)
    let mut sequence = keyframes![
         (0.5, 0.0), // <-- EaseInOut used from 0.0 to 0.3
         (1.5, 0.3, Linear), // <-- Linear used from 0.3 to 1.0
         (2.5, 1.0) // <-- Easing function here is never used, since we're at the end
    ];

    sequence.advance_by(0.65);

    assert_eq!(sequence.now(), 2.0);
    assert_eq!(sequence.duration(), 1.0);
}
```

### [Implementing a Turn-Based Game in an ECS with SPECS-Task][tbs-ecs]

[@bonsairobo] published an article
["Implementing a Turn-Based Game in an ECS with SPECS-Task"][tbs-ecs]:

> I’ve heard from a few people who are just getting started with
> entity component systems (ECS) that implementing logic for a turn-based game
> seems more complicated than it should be.
> I thought that seemed odd, but I just recently ran into this problem myself.
> While certainly not insurmountable, implementing turn-based logic
> in an ECS just doesn’t feel great.
> I think the reason is that no one likes to implement a loop
> via distributed state machines.
