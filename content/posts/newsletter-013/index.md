Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [SPIR-Q]

[SPIR-Q] is a light-weight shader reflection library, which allows you to query
the types, offsets, sizes and even names in your shaders procedurally. SPIR-Q
supports not only descriptor bindings, input/output variables, but also push
constants and specialization constants; not only uniform buffers but also
dynamically-sized storage buffers, textures, separable samplers and even storage
images with component format detail. The latest version of SPIR-Q (v0.4.6) is in
conformance with the specification of SPIR-V 1.5, supporting all shader stages
accepted by the latest core profile of the Vulkan API, Vulkan 1.2.

### [Inline SPIR-V]

![inline-spirv](inline-spirv-demo.png)

[Inline SPIR-V] is a single-crate build-time shader compilation library based on
shaderc which provides procedural macros to help you translate shader sources,
in either GLSL or HLSL, inline or from-file, into SPIR-Vs and embed the SPIR-Vs
right inside your code as `u32` slices. Despite basic shader compilation,
`inline-spirv` also support `#include` directives, macro substitution,
post-compile optimization, as well as descriptor auto-binding.
