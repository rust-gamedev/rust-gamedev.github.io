Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### NeoCogi's libraries

[Jude3D](https://neocogi.com) is a web based 3D sculpting application!
It's a webassembly application, written in C/C++ and compiled using emscripten.
After much thinking we decided to move the development to Rust!

![Jude3D](jude3d.png)

Many problems arise when moving existing C/C++/webassembly code to Rust.
The 2 most important ones:

- The new code should still interop with the already existing code
- Payload size matters on the web: Your wasm app should be as small as possible

These led us to drop using rust's std in favor to our own libs (`!#[no_std]`),
at least until the std library crates are split up accordingly and stabilized,
for example the `alloc` crate.

The good news is that we are releasing most of the libraries as we make them as
 open source!

[NeoCogi Repo](https://github.com/NeoCogi)

We have included an example that showcase the libs:
[Webassembly glfw3/gles2 example](https://github.com/NeoCogi/rs-glfw3-gles2-test)
[Live example](https://neocogi.github.io/rs-glfw3-gles2-test)

A good example that you can build and run with wasm32-unknown-emscripten!
