### [Egregoria]

![Egregoria buildings screenshot](egregoria.png)

[Egregoria]'s objective is to become a granular society simulation,
filled with fully autonomous agents interacting with their world in real time.
Egregoria was previously known as Scale,
but was renamed to fit the theme better.

The [5th devlog][egregoria-blog-post] was published, talking about
the renaming, project managment, buildings and scripting.

A [Discord][egregoria-discord] server was launched to discuss the project.

### [Cary]

[![Dodging bullets and carrying Cary to temporary safety](cary_screenshot.png)][Cary]

In [Cary] the player has to bring the titular character to the exit by carying
them or otherwise making sure they don't – nor the player themselves –
touch any of the traps.
Easier said then done when you have limited stamina and Cary keeps running
into spikes.

Made with hecs and wgpu (no framework), but uses WebGL on the web
because of the current implementation status of WebGPU.

Made during the [Extra Credits game jam][extra-credits-jam],
it's a rather small game.
It can be played in the browser or downloaded at [itch.io][Cary].

### [Chillscapes][chillscapes-itch]

![Chillscapes Main Menu](chillscapes_main_menu.png)

[Chillscapes][chillscapes-github] is a lo-fi
rhythm experience created for the [NEOC#03 Rhythm Game Jam][neoc]. Using
layerable lo-fi music tracks, the game has you tap with the rhythm of the loops
being added, before changing the music up by adding another loop into the mix.
Last week, [a retrospective update was published][chillscapes-retrospective]
reflecting on what the developer's takeaways were from the experience.

Chillscapes is written using an early-in-development 2d engine,
[Kludgine][kludgine]. For audio playback, rodio was utilized. The source code is
[available on GitHub][chillscapes-github].

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [Rapier: 2D and 3D Physics Engines Focused on Performance][rapier-august]

[![Rapier logo](rapier-logo.svg)][Rapier]

[Rapier] is a new set of 2D and 3D physics engines written 100% in Rust.
It is 5 to 10 times faster than [nphysics], close to the performances of the
CPU version of PhysX, and often slightly faster than Box2D.

[For its first release][rapier-august] Rapier includes:

- rigid-body dynamics;
- colliders and sensors;
- joint constraints;
- optional serialization of the physics state;
- optional cross-platform determinism on IEEE-754 compliant targets;
- optional explicit SIMD and parallelism.
- JavaScript bindings with official NPM packages.

This new physics engine is developed by the recently created [Dimforge]
single-member Open-Source company [replacing][dimforge-replace] the former
Rustsim organization created on GitHub by [@sebcrozet].

### [cute-c2]

![cute-c2 collision](cute-c2-collision.gif)

cute-c2 is a 2D collision detection library that has had its first release to
[crates.io][cute-c2]. The library is a Rust wrapper around the [c2.h] library.

The library can detect collisions between circles, rectangles, capsules and
up to eight-sided convex polygons. There are also functions for manifold
generation, the GJK algorithm and ray casting operations. There is an example
program in the repository.

### [hexasphere] v1.0

![hexasphere example gif](hexasphere.gif)

The [hexasphere] library provides a customizable interface for subdividing 3D
triangle meshes. Custom and stateful interpolation functions can be implemented
as well as per-vertex attributes.

All that's required to define a base shape are the initial vertices, triangles
based on the indices of the vertices in the initial vertices, and numbered
edges. As long as the winding of the triangles remains consistend throughout
the base mesh, all of the resulting triangles will retain that winding.

This library also provides a few interesting base shapes (which can be used alone
if the shape is not subdivided):
Icosahedron, Tetrahedron, Cube, Square Plane, Triangle Plane
(all of which are pictured above).

[hexasphere]: https://crates.io/crates/hexasphere

### [blitz-path](https://github.com/BezPowell/blitz-path)

[blitz-path](https://github.com/BezPowell/blitz-path) is a new crate providing
an implementation of the [JPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_point_search)
pathfinding algorithm.

JPS is an optimization of the A* search algorithm for uniform-cost grids, which
are common in games. While fully functional, the code is still in an early
state and any suggestions for improvements - especially on how best to
integrate it with the existing ecosystem - are greatly appreciated.

### [This Month in Mun][mun-august]

[![Mun logo](mun-logo.png)][Mun]

### [SPIR-Q] v0.4.6

[SPIR-Q] is a light-weight shader reflection library, which allows you to query
the types, offsets, sizes and even names in your shaders procedurally.

This month v0.4.2..v0.4.6 versions were released.
Some of the updates:

- Specialization constants enumeration.
- Dynamically sized multi-binding support.
- Improved entrypoint debug printing.
- Better manifest merging method for pipeline construction.

### [Inline SPIR-V]

![inline-spirv](inline-spirv-demo.png)

[Inline SPIR-V] is a single-crate build-time shader compilation library based on
shaderc which provides procedural macros to help you translate shader sources,
in either GLSL or HLSL, inline or from-file, into SPIR-Vs and embed the SPIR-Vs
right inside your code as `u32` slices. Despite basic shader compilation,
`inline-spirv` also support `#include` directives, macro substitution,
post-compile optimization, as well as descriptor auto-binding.

### [Egui]

[Egui] is a highly portable immediate mode GUI library in pure Rust.
Egui can be integrated anywhere you can paint textured triangles.
You can compile Egui to WASM and render it on a web page using [egui_web]
or compile and run natively using [egui_glium].

[Click to run Egui web demo](https://emilk.github.io/egui/index.html)

Example:

```rust
Window::new("Debug").show(ui.ctx(), |ui| {
    ui.label(format!("Hello, world {}", 123));
    if ui.button("Save").clicked {
        my_save_function();
    }
    ui.text_edit(&mut my_string);
    ui.add(Slider::f32(&mut value, 0.0..=1.0).text("float"));
});
```

```rust
fn my_function() {
    puffin::profile_function!():
    ...
    if ... {
        puffin::profile_scope_data!("load_image", image_name):
        ...
    }
}
```

The collected profile data can be viewed ingame with [imgui-rs].
