Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Egui]

[Egui] is a highly portable immediate mode GUI library in pure Rust.
Egui can be integrated anywhere you can paint textured triangles.
You can compile Egui to WASM and render it on a web page using [egui_web]
or compile and run natively using [egui_glium].

[Click to run Egui web demo](https://emilk.github.io/egui/index.html)

Example:

``` rust
Window::new("Debug").show(ui.ctx(), |ui| {
    ui.label(format!("Hello, world {}", 123));
    if ui.button("Save").clicked {
        my_save_function();
    }
    ui.text_edit(&mut my_string);
    ui.add(Slider::f32(&mut value, 0.0..=1.0).text("float"));
});
```
