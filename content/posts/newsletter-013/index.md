Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [SIMple Physics][simple-physics-site]

[SIMple Physics][simple-physics-site] by [@mkhan45] is a set of educational physics
simulators meant to help students and teachers conduct labs without expensive equipment
or in person classes. Each simulator uses serializeable graphs, object inspection,
Lua scripting, and a few other features to help students learn. Currently, there
is a simulator for mechanics/projectile motion and one for universal gravitation,
but the goal is to include one for electronics/magnetism and one for waves/optics.

Written in Rust using `ggez`, `specs`, `imgui-rs`, and `nphysics`, this project's
goals include:

- Performance
- Accessibility/Portability
- Ease of use
- Extensibility

watch some cool gifs [here][simple-physics-gifs], or read the GitHub page
