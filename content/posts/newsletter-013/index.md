Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup‚Äôs
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [vange-rs]

![vangers-shadow](vangers-shadows.jpeg)

[vange-rs] is the project of re-implementing the [Vangers] game (from 1998)
in Rust using modern development practices, parallel computations, and GPU.

This month vange-rs got real-time shadows!
See [video on /r/rust_gamedev][vangers-shadow-video] and technical description
on the [Hybrid Shadows][vangers-shadow-blog] post of the blog.

Another exciting development - the new bruteforce rendering technique allowing
to shift the camera behind the mechos as in 3rd person view.
See [video on /r/rust_gamedev][vangers-bars-video] and technical description on
the [Bar Painting][vangers-bars-blog] post of the blog.

## Learning Material Updates

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [gfx-rs][gfx-repo] and [wgpu][wgpu-site]

_wgpu-rs's [water example][wgpu-water]_

gfx-rs project and wgpu ecosystem have observed the release of 0.6 versions! üéâ

Some of the updates:

- Reworked project structure:
  - `wgpu-core` - a safe pure-Rust internal API, implementing WebGPU specification;
  - `wgpu-rs` - the idiomatic Rust wrapper;
  - `wgpu-native` - the C API wrapper, aiming to be compatible with [Dawn];
  - Gecko and Servo - for implementing WebGPU API in the browsers.
- Ability to record API traces, replay them on a different machine,
  and run data-driven tests.
- `write_buffer` and `write_texture` for update the GPU data
  without intermediate staging buffers or encoders.
- A number of powerful native-only extensions, such as descriptor indexing,
  as well as web-compatible extensions like depth-clamping.
- [naga] v0.2 - an experimental shader translation library.
- The [showcase gallery](https://wgpu.rs/#showcase) was updated.

Read about the details on [gfx-rs blog](https://gfx-rs.github.io/2020/08/18/release-0.6.html).

[@sothr](https://github.com/sothr) has reworked the
[wgpu instancing tutorial][wgpu-instancing-tutor].
