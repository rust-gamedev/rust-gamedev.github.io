Welcome to the 13th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [vange-rs][vange-repo]

![vangers-shadow](https://gfx-rs.github.io/img/vangers-shadows.png)

Vangers got real-time shadows!
See [video on /r/rust_gamedev][vangers-shadow-video] and technical description on the [Hybrid Shadows][vangers-shadow-blog] post of the blog.

Another exciting development - the new bruteforce rendering technique allowing to shift the camera behind the mechos as in 3rd person view.
See [video on /r/rust_gamedev](vangers-bars-video) and technical description on the [Bar Painting][vangers-bars-blog] post of the blog.
