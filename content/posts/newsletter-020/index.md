Welcome to the 20th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [A/B Street]

![Elevation data in A/B Street](./abstreet.jpg)

[A/B Street] by [@dabreegster] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
support for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage.

In March, elevation data courtesy of [Eldan] was imported, letting cycling
speeds uphill be adjusted. Importing any area from OpenStreetMap can now be
done from the UI with no command-line experience, and custom travel demand
models based on UK-wide census data can now be generated. Some important
simulation fixes for roundabouts improve gridlock, and [Michael] and [Yuwen]
helped adjust the UI panel layout for smaller screens.

## Engine Updates

### Emerald

![emerald_logo](./em_desktop_icon.png)

[Emerald][emerald_github] by [@bombfuse][bombfuse_twitter]
is a 2D game engine focused on being as portable as possible.

The ultimate goal of Emerald is to be a fully
featured engine that you can slap onto any
device with relative ease.
It's currently able to run on WASM,
Raspberry Pi, Mac, Windows, and Linux
thanks to [miniquad][miniquad_git].

Features:

- Physics via [rapier2d][rapier_2d]
- ECS via [hecs][hecs_git]
- Font rendering via [fontdue][fontdue_git]

New Updates:

- Rendering to textures
- [WASM game sample][em_wasm_example]

## Learning Material Updates

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [wgpu]

![voxel bunny on wgpu](wgpu-conservative-bunny.png)
Voxel Bunny rendering with conservative rasterization

[wgpu] is a [WebGPU] implementation in Rust. It is safe, efficient,
and portable: can target both native (Vulkan/D3D/Metal) and the Web.

Most progress in April was focused around [WGSL] shaders and validation.
[naga] has seen a lot of improvements in the SPIR-V and WGSL parsing, as well
as backend code generation. Most importantly, it now fully validates both
statements and expressions. No more accidental foot shots from adding vec2
and vec3 in the shaders!

The last and the biggest (in terms of shader complexity) example - "water"
has been successfully ported to WGSL üéâ.

A small addition to our native-only features - conservative rasterization
feature - was added by [@wumpf] and demonstrated on a voxel bunny üêá

Finally, there is a blog post on Mozilla [graphics team blog] about the
progress using [wgpu] in Gecko.
