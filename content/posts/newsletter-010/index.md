## Game Updates

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Buildings](veloren1.png)

^ _The new repo banner_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In May, Veloren 0.6 was launched! Check out the launch trailer below for an
overview of the changes. The launch party was a massive success with nearly 50
people online at the peak. In May, character persistence was added. This allows
players to save their level after leaving the server. Dungeons were merged right
before the release, and include bosses. Many small bugs were fixed for the
release as well. Veloren also now has an [Open Collective
account][veloren-opencollective], and you can donate towards our infrastructure
costs. GamingOnLinux [wrote an article][gamingonlinux] on Veloren's development.

[![0.6 release trailer](veloren_trailer.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjDFVgWYMd4)

^ _0.6 release trailer. Click for the full video!_

Here is the May changelog:

- Added server-side character saving
- Player now starts with a lantern.
- Added tab completion in chat for player names and chat commands
- Added server persistence for character stats
- Added a popup when setting your character's waypoint
- Added dungeon arenas
- Added dungeon bosses and rare boss loot
- Added 2 sets of armour. One Steel and one Leather.
- Added context-sensitive crosshair

A 0.7 intro meeting was held, in which we looked at what we wanted to achieve
with this version. 0.7 will be released August 1st. We came up with a definition
of 0.7, and what we wanted to achieve:

> As a player, I want to get quests from NPCs in settlements. I want to be sent
> to kill enemies, collect objects, or complete dungeons. I want to be sent from
> village to village and become familiar with the region.
>
> I want to be able to open the map and get information where I need to go for a
> quest. I want to be able to easily find where dungeons, villages, and other
> points of interest are. I want to be able to open a trade window with NPCs in
> villages, and buy and sell items. I want to be able to craft items with
> ingredients that I have.
>
> I want to be able to see and hear more while in combat. I want to feel good
> while doing combat. I want to see particle effects from magic, and hear swords
> clashing together. I want to be able to add people to my combat party and
> interact with the game UI to do this.

### [Paddlers][paddlers-website]

![Paddlers v0.1.3 screenshot](paddlers.jpg)

Paddlers is a multiplayer strategy game with a [live prototype][paddlers-demo]
available online to demonstrate its current status.
It is a learning-by-doing hobby project to explore the possibilities with
Rust on the web, developed by a single person so far but open to contributors.

May was a busy month for Paddlers and brought many fundamental changes and new
features, including the ability to observe other player's villages.
A summary of changes is available on the [Paddlers news page][paddlers-news].

Besides programming, the developer of Paddlers also wrote a blog post called
[Benefits of full-stack Rust][paddlers-blog] where he details some of his
experiences when implementing a server-client model using Rust on both ends.
Furthermore, he published a first [video teaser][paddlers-teaser].

### Sailing Simulator Prototype

![screenhot: an island, sea, and a few boats](sailing-sim.jpg)

This is unnamed game is still in the prototype stage and
it's the new project of Kunos Simulazioni
(creators of the [Assetto Corsa] racing simulation franchise)
co-founder and former Lead Programmer [Stefano Casillo] who started
a new studio (Jaxx Vane Studio) in April 2020 in the search of new challenges.

It's going to be a modern Foling/Sailing Simulator aiming to bring the depth,
rigor and attention to detail found in racing simulations to the sailing genre
on PC/Windows.
The game features a fully custom scratch made 3D engine written in Rust
with minimal dependencies using DirectX 11 via winapi-rs, ODE
and OpenAL with custom bindings.

The project should leave the prototype stage later next month.
The development is streamed live 3 times a week on [Twitch][sailing-twitch]
with highlights also published on [YouTube][sailing-youtube].

### [Sandbox]

[![Sandbox gameplay demo](sandbox.jpeg)](https://streamable.com/0bhbol#)

^ _click to see a gameplay demo_

[Sandbox] is a falling sand game by JMS55 that provides a variety of fun
particle types to place, and then you get to watch the resulting interactions!

The main focus so far has been experimenting with different particle types, including:

- Sand
- Acid - Dissolves material.
- Water
- Replicator - Creates infinite copies of other particles.
- Plant - Grows over time once placed on wet Sand, or on top of an existing
  plant.
- Cyrotheum - A cold particle that melts over time, and releases a wave of
  cold to its surroundings.
- Unstable - Heats up over time, vaporizing a large radius at too high
  of a tempature, and releases Smoke.
- Electricity - Can only exist when falling, or in Water.
  Flows through Water. Very hot.
- Glass - Created by heating up Sand. Acts like a liquid at
  high enough tempatures, and a solid otherwise. Immune to Acid.
- Life - A semi-intelligent particle that stacks itself up, and moves
  as a group. Likes to breed upon eating Plants. Will jump down short drops.
  Dies if too hot or cold, or upon falling a large distance.
- Blood - Created by pressurizing dead Life particles, by stacking
  enough of other particles on top.

Got any ideas? Leave an [issue on github][Sandbox], or add it yourself!

### For The Quest

![For The Quest screenshot](forthequest.jpg)

For The Quest is the working title for a game in early development by
[@seratonik]. Written entirely in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly,
For The Quest is destined to become a MMORPG set in a post-apocalyptic
Earth where your goal is to band together into like-minded factions to
not only survive in this new world, but to unearth the cause of humanity's
downfall.

For The Quest is currently undergoing engine development with a focus on
running smoothly in modern browsers using WebGL 2.0 before moving onto
native desktop ports.

New developments in May:

- All game assets are now defined server-side in a database and are streamed
  to the client on demand as areas are requested
- New desert / sand assets added to test the new asset loading system
- Translucent water surfaces with primitive refraction effect added
- New "picking" system implemented that is aware of the 3D coordinates at
  location of selection in addition to being aware of which object selected
- A basic world editing UI has been built in React / Javascript and interfaced
  to the game engine via WASM bindings, features include: displaying info about
  currently selected object, deleting objects, adding any object type, creating
  new maps and teleporting to any existing map
- Map changes are persisted on the server and location of player is now
  restored when closing the client and coming back later

### [Crate Before Attack][cratebeforeattack-site]

[![screenshot: decision tree and goal distance map in the background](crate_before_attack.png)][cratebeforeattack-site]

^ _Decision tree and goal distance map in the background_

[Crate Before Attack][cratebeforeattack-site] by [koalefant (@CrateAttack)][@CrateAttack]
is a realtime/turn-based multiplayer game where frogs combat their friends
while navigating the landscape with their sticky tongues.

May development was focused on implementing AI of opponents and adding race mode:

- [Video of AI racing against itself with visualized decision tree][cratebeforeattack-youtube-ai];
- [Playable build][cratebeforeattack-play] (works in the browser on PC or Mac).

## Learning Material Updates

### Rust Sokoban Tutorial

![sokoban update](sokoban_2.jpeg)

The Rust Sokoban tutorial is an online book aimed at Rust gamedev beginners
which walks through making a simple Sokoban game using ECS, ggez and specs.
It tries to teach the basics of architecting in ECS and basic Rust concepts
through a hands-on approach.

This month:

- the project received 10+ contributions from beta testers
- work was started on chapter 3 which features advanced gameplay

You can follow along for updates and release progress [here][updates].

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [Goods]

Asset management library that aims to be easy to use, flexible, extensible
and support virtually any use-case:

- Need to load compund asset that pulls subassets without boilerplate on
  call-site? All heavy-lifting for loading subassets can be done in `Format`
  implementation for the asset type.
- Asset is made of GPU resources and access to graphics device is required to
  create asset instance? `Asset::build` receives reference to `Asset::Context`.
- Targeting browser? `goods` support building for wasm
  and even bundle Fetch API based asset data source.
- Target doesn't have `std`? Core types and traits are `no_std` compatible.
  But `alloc` is required.
- Looking to keep things tidy and fast to build? Clean build of the crate
  with no features takes about ~3s on modern CPU.
- Integration with `serde` ecosystem? Special `Format` implementations can load
  assets whose representation implement `serde::de::DeserializeOwned`.
  Crate includes `Format`s for loading assets from JSON, YAML and RON docuemts.

Crate's repo has few examples with nearly each line of the code explained.

### [This Month in Mun][mun-may]

[![Mun logo](mun-logo.png)][Mun]

[Mun] is a scripting language for gamedev focused on quick iteration times
that is written in Rust.

After half a year of hard work by the Mun Community and Core Team,
[Mun v0.2.0 was released][mun-release].
With the addition of hot reloadable structs, this
forms a big step forward in terms of hot reloadability for the language.

Their additional [May updates][mun-may] include:

- number type inferencing;
- removing generic `float`, `int`, and `uint` types;
- updating the Mun book;
- an official VSCode plugin for Mun syntax highlighting;
- documentation fixes and improvements.

### [Tetra 0.3.6][tetra-036]

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA and Raylib. This month,
[version 0.3.6 was released][tetra-036], featuring:

- A new suite of functions for querying information
  about the player's connected monitors
- Tweaks to the startup code, to ensure slow asset loading
  doesn't cause the window to hang
- Several under the hood bug fixes

Additionally, planning for 0.4 has begun, which will
[bring some changes to the `Font`/`Text` API][tetra-040].

#### [rusty editor]

![rusty editor](rusty_editor.jpg)

[rusty editor] is a scene editor for rg3d engine, the goal is to make robust
and easy-to-use editor which is able to load, modify, and save scenes in
native engine format. The editor is based on rg3d engine, user interface
is based on rg3d-ui crate which developing in parallel with editor. It is
still in very early development phase, but it already have some basic
features:

- Undo/redo
- Saving and loading of scenes.
- Interaction modes (move, scale, rotate).
