Welcome to the 19th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Teki (敵)][teki]

![teki preview](teki.gif)

[Teki][teki] is a free and open-source fangame of the [Tōhō] series
using [SDL2] and [Legion] for ECS. It is aimed to be a shoot ’em up game with
"lots of bullets" a.k.a danmaku 弾幕 - literally "barrage" or "bullet curtain" in
Japanese.

The project is still at a “very” early stage of development (Dec. 2020).

This month's updates include:

- New enemy type: big fairy
- New special card: Stellar Vortex
- Add yin yang orbs

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

[Version 0.4][rkyv-v0.4] was released this month and brought some big changes
and improvements:

- Major traits have been refactored and renamed to clarify their roles
- Shared pointers (`Rc`, `Arc`, `Weak`) can now be serialized, deserialized,
  and validated with correct ownership semantics
- Serialization, deserialization, and validation all now support custom contexts
- Greatly improved support for 32- and 64-bit archives by implementing Archive
  for `usize` and `isize`
- More comprehensive documentation in the [book][rkyv-book]

This release completes the project's initial feature set, and a
[request for feedback][rkyv-request-for-feedback] has been opened to help with
future project planning.
