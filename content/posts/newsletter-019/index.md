Welcome to the 19th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [wgpu-rs], [gfx-rs], and [naga]

wgpu-rs (WebGPU implementation and API in Rust):

  - "wgpu-core"-0.7.1 was published with fixes
  - API updated for blending states, cull faces, vertex formats.
  - zero-initialization of buffers upon use.
  - validation of texture bindings, index formats for strip topologies.
  - binding tracker was rewritten with test-ability in mind, bugs fixed.
  - the player learned to resize the window properly. API traces can now
    be replayed on Linux even when swapchain recreation events are present.
  - SPIRV-Cross was made optional, which was useful for Deno in order to
    work around the linking conflict with "rusty_v8".

gfx-rs (portable low-level graphics abstraction layer):

  - API got `PhysicalDeviceProperties` containing limits and properties of
    physical devices that are not opt-in.
  - SPIRV-Cross dependency was made optional, while Naga is required.
  - Vulkan backend learned to target Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 internally.
  - DX12 understood more limits.
  - GL backend fixed WebGL initialization and EGL library discovery.

naga (shader translation infrastructure):

  - versions 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 were published with fixes
  - API additions:
    - function calls turned into statements
    - image queries
    - image stores
    - rudimentary push constants support
  - validation:
    - control flow uniformity requirements
    - type validation was rewritten and improved
    - gathering of the image-sampler pairs
  - backends: lots of fixes and filling of the gaps
  - infrastructure:
    - `convert` example was removed in favor of the default binary target
    - produced native shaders are now validated on CI using platform tools
