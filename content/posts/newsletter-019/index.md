Welcome to the 19th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

![A brightly colored scene with a grass field, a river, and some happy ducks.](paddlers_0.2.1.jpg)

[Paddlers] ([GitHub][paddlers-gh], [Online Demo][paddlers-demo]) by [@jakmeier]
is an experimental MMORTS with the backend and the web client all written in
Rust.

February gave birth to Paddlers release 0.2.1 and a ton of new game mechanics.
It features a skill map, quests, and a refreshed take on the tower defense
aspect of the game. On top of that, the rendering engine (part of the
[Paddle][paddle] framework) has been reworked and now allows for custom
shaders. Read all about this month's changes in this
[article][paddlers-article] released on the developer's private website.

_Homing missiles periodically spawn from missile launcher enemies_

[Theta Wave] is a space shooter game by developers [@micah_tigley] and
[@carlosupina]. It is one of the showcase games for the [Amethyst Engine].
In the past month, they have been focusing on refactoring the motion system

### [macroquad]

![macroquad_gui](macroquad_skins.gif)
_Macroquad-UI runtime GUI skins configuration._

[macroquad] is a cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS/Android/iOS/WASM)
game framework built on top of [miniquad].  

This month biggest update: Macroquad got its own fully skinnable and
customizable immediate mode UI system üéâ.  
The new system took origins from heavily refactored [megaui] and support
custom font sizes, fonts and skins for each UI element.  
While work is still in progress, all important decisions were made and
implementation [PR][macroquad-ui-pr] got merged.

Minor updates:

- [Textures support][macroquad-textures-pr] for macroquad materials
- Experimental 2D pan/zoom camera [implementation][macroquad-camera-pr]

### [A/B Street]

![Separate cyclepaths in A/B Street](./abstreet.png)

[A/B Street] by [@dabreegster] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
suppot for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage.

In February, [Bruce] implemented lagging green traffic signals, [Michael] and
[Yuwen] released the new day UI theme, more cyclepaths and service roads were
imported for all maps, and we added loads of maps, a new per-country picker UI,
and dynamic font loading. Try out [Taipei] in the web browser to see all of
this in action!

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

[Version 0.4][rkyv-v0.4] was released this month and brought some big changes
and improvements:

- Major traits have been refactored and renamed to clarify their roles
- Shared pointers (`Rc`, `Arc`, `Weak`) can now be serialized, deserialized,
  and validated with correct ownership semantics
- Serialization, deserialization, and validation all now support custom contexts
- Greatly improved support for 32- and 64-bit archives by implementing Archive
  for `usize` and `isize`
- More comprehensive documentation in the [book][rkyv-book]

This release completes the project's initial feature set, and a
[request for feedback][rkyv-request-for-feedback] has been opened to help with
future project planning.
