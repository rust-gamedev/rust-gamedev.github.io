Welcome to the 15th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Worship The Sun

![Worship The Sun](worship-sun.jpg)
_One of the many unique and confounding puzzles in the game_

Worship The Sun is a dark, mysterious 2D puzzle-platform game with computer
science themes. It introduces the player to a rich language of puzzle elements
and challenges them to solve difficult puzzles that require experimentation,
comprehension and internalisation of the game's mechanics.

The game is built using a custom engine that sits on top of [legion][legion],
[wgpu][wgpu] and a handful of other crates. It features dynamic lighting, a
flexible particle system, bespoke collision behaviour and a Vim-inspired level
editor. The majority of game assets are hand drawn in [Procreate][procreate]
and painstakingly animated.

The game is a few months into development with a release target of late 2021.
You can read about how swimming was added to the game in [GameDev Note 1:
Taking the Plunge][plunge] which contains a sneak peek at some of the levels.

### [Camp Misty]

![Camp Misty Title Screen](camp-misty.PNG)

[Camp Misty] is an asymmetric
multiplayer game played on the command line. The game is played with two
people. One of the players is a helpless victim searching for car parts. If
they find all of the parts, they can repair their car and escape the camp. The
other player is a ruthless killer who is trying to hunt down the victim.

The game was created as a learning exercise in about two weeks by
[@ReeCocho], with contributions from the many helpful members of [/r/rust].

### [Antorum Online]

![A small marketplace area with a few merchants](antorum-online-10-29-2020.jpg)

Antorum Online is a micro-multiplayer online role-playing game by [@dooskington].
The game server is written in Rust, and the current "official" client is being
developed in Unity. The server can be self-hosted, and the network protocol is
open, so even custom clients that adhere to the protocol can connect and play.

Two more devlogs were published this month, regarding work done to implement
shops, character creation, and a few other features:

- [21: Belmart, Shops, And Bartering](https://ratwizard.dev/dev-log/antorum/21)
- [22: Character Creation And Customization](https://ratwizard.dev/dev-log/antorum/22)
