Welcome to the 15th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Worship The Sun

![Worship The Sun](worship-sun.jpg)
_One of the many unique and confounding puzzles in the game_

Worship The Sun is a dark, mysterious 2D puzzle-platform game with computer
science themes. It introduces the player to a rich language of puzzle elements
and challenges them to solve difficult puzzles that require experimentation,
comprehension and internalisation of the game's mechanics.

The game is built using a custom engine that sits on top of [legion][legion],
[wgpu][wgpu] and a handful of other crates. It features dynamic lighting, a
flexible particle system, bespoke collision behaviour and a Vim-inspired level
editor. The majority of game assets are hand drawn in [Procreate][procreate]
and painstakingly animated.

The game is a few months into development with a release target of late 2021.
You can read about how swimming was added to the game in [GameDev Note 1:
Taking the Plunge][plunge] which contains a sneak peek at some of the levels.
For updates and possible playtesting opportunities, follow

### [Camp Misty]

![Camp Misty Title Screen](camp-misty.PNG)

[Camp Misty] is an asymmetric
multiplayer game played on the command line. The game is played with two
people. One of the players is a helpless victim searching for car parts. If
they find all of the parts, they can repair their car and escape the camp. The
other player is a ruthless killer who is trying to hunt down the victim.

The game was created as a learning exercise in about two weeks by
[@ReeCocho], with contributions from the many helpful members of [/r/rust].

### [Antorum Online]

![A small marketplace area with a few merchants](antorum-online-10-29-2020.jpg)

Antorum Online is a micro-multiplayer online role-playing game by [@dooskington].
The game server is written in Rust, and the current "official" client is being
developed in Unity. The server can be self-hosted, and the network protocol is
open, so even custom clients that adhere to the protocol can connect and play.

Two more devlogs were published this month, regarding work done to implement
shops, character creation, and a few other features:

- [21: Belmart, Shops, And Bartering](https://ratwizard.dev/dev-log/antorum/21)
- [22: Character Creation And Customization](https://ratwizard.dev/dev-log/antorum/22)

### [Power Kick]

![Power Kick](power-kick-shot.png)

[Power Kick] is an one screen platform game inspired by similar old arcade games
like Bubble Bobble and SnowBros.
Your task is to hit the enemies till they get dizzy and then kick them out of
their misery to proceed to the next stage. The kicked enemies will hit the
colliding enemies with a possibility to create a chain reaction
(similar to the pushed snowball in SnowBros).

The game have 20 stages and in stage 10 and 20 you will face a helicopter boss.

Can be played solo on the web through WebAssembly or up to two players
in the downloadable version:
first player with the keyboard and the second one with a joypad.

The development took around two weeks thanks to [macroquad] and [hecs].

- Implementing save data import and parsing.
- Implementing world navigation system.
- Implementing rudimentary CLI graphics (for debugging and some future use).

Main features of reported (pre-alpha) version are:

- Ability to generate and explore one or many worlds (see previous news).

For main feature reports and dev blogs follow [@pGLOWrpg] on Twitter.

### [Space Shooter]

![space shooter boss fight](space_shooter_11-03-2020.gif)

Recent development has been focused on creating an online book for documentation
for the game. While still a work in progress, the following content is now
available:

- [Gameplay]
- [Contributing Code]
- [Adding Items]

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [rust-psp]

![tetris on rust-psp](rust-psp-tetris-small.jpg)

Move over Tetris Effect and Tetris 99, the first game has been created with
[rust-psp], and it's [Tetris]! This was a big step because it proves that
rust-psp is ready for game development, even though it's still `#![no_std]`.
`std` support is a work in progress, and the project is always open to new
contributors to the library, the tooling, or people who want to make PSP games
in Rust.

Another development for rust-psp this month is [reverse engineering]
of the Sony library for the hardware vector floating point unit of the PSP.
All the vector and matrix operations provided by the Sony library have been
PR'ed to rust-psp's main repo, and there are still more functions to come.

To stay up to date on [rust-psp] development, you can join the project's [Discord]
or follow [@sajattack] on Twitter.
