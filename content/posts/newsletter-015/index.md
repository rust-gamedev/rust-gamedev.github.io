Welcome to the 15th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Antorum Online]

![A small marketplace area with a few merchants](antorum-online-10-29-2020.jpg)

Antorum Online is a micro-multiplayer online role-playing game by [@dooskington].
The game server is written in Rust, and the current "official" client is being
developed in Unity. The server can be self-hosted, and the network protocol is
open, so even custom clients that adhere to the protocol can connect and play.

Two more devlogs were published this month, regarding work done to implement
shops, character creation, and a few other features:

- [21: Belmart, Shops, And Bartering](https://ratwizard.dev/dev-log/antorum/21)
- [22: Character Creation And Customization](https://ratwizard.dev/dev-log/antorum/22)

[full example][ogmo3-sample] was added, showing how a simple project can be
loadedinto a game engine.
