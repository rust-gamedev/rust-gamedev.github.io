### [Veloren][veloren]

![Airship](veloren.jpg) _The beginning of an exciting journey_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

Veloren's 3rd birthday was at the end of May, on the 25th! During the month,
lots of systems were overhauled. Music changes were made to only play certain
tracks in certain areas. Econsim was optimized, and many bugs were fixed. The
minimap was overhauled, with many quality-of-life and visual improvements.
Terrain compression speed was worked on, with many trials of different
compression techniques.

The large physics overhaul was merged, and lots of patches are being added to
issues that popped up from it. You can see a small flight in action
[here][veloren-glider]. Dungeons have been balanced, and many weapons have also
seen changes. In June, 0.10 will be released.

### [A/B Street]

![Most of West Seattle has poor access to public libraries](abstreet.png)

[A/B Street] by [@dabreegster] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
support for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage. The project aims to engage
more citizens with transportation planning, letting people advocate for real
changes they want to see.

In May, travel time stopped being the only "score" for how well road changes
work. Risk exposure of cyclists crossing dangerous intersections or travelling
in front of high-speed traffic is now measured, with lots of data visualization
work by Michael. Trevor also revived the 15-minute isochrone tool, finding
areas of a city without easy access to education, hospitals, or other
facilities. We also moved the map import process, with over 100 supported maps,
to the cloud from a single poor laptop. OpenStreetMap importing now handles
multiple turn lanes, U-turns, and stop signs much better.

### [Outer Wonders]

![Animation showing Bibi, the main protagonist of Outer Wonders,
starting from the top entrance of a puzzle, rolling from obstacle
to obstacle, leaning on on bushes, flowers and trees to reach
the bottom exit of the puzzle](outer-wonders.gif)

[Outer Wonders] is a colorful, pixel art, puzzle-based adventure game
developed by [Utopixel] where you play as Bibi, a cute round monkey who
enjoys rolling in straight lines. Explore a whimsical nature where
altering the environment is key to progress, and solve puzzles to protect
its wonders.

Outer Wonders can be downloaded for Linux and Windows from [itch.io].

May was mostly dedicated to code cleaning, small improvements, as well as
blogging and community building. Updates of the month include:

- Refactored UI code to streamline menu stacking and ease the implementation
  of an upcoming options menu.
- Added support for menu navigation using the D-Pad alongside the existing
  analog stick support.
- Published a blog post about building Outer Wonders for Linux/itch.io
  ([english], [french]).
- Posted weekly puzzles [#16], [#17], [#18] and [#19] on social media
  for players wishing to give puzzles a try prior to downloading the game.

_This factory has never looked livelier!_

[The Process] by @setzer22 is an upcoming game about factory building, process
management and carrot production, built with Rust using the Godot game engine!

This month has been focused on improving the game's UI and extending the machine
logistics system, but there was also room for a few cosmetic improvements:

- Improved visualization of connections in the [logistic
  network](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1391484080798281728).

### [Bounty Bros.][bounty_bros]

[![bounty-bros-title-screen](bounty-bros.png)][bounty_bros_webgame]
_Click the image to play the game in your browser!_

[Bounty Bros.][bounty_bros] is a prototype game, similar to the old Legend of
ZeldaÂ® games, developed by [Katharos Technology][katharostech] as a testing
ground for a future commercial game.

The last two months of development was primarily focused on sound and user
interface:

- Music will play in different areas of the map and fade in when walking into
  an area with different music.
- In-game UI is now functional including a new start menu and a simple settings
  menu to toggle the CRT filter and pixel aspect ratio.
- The web-player now has a simple loading icon instead of a solid black screen.

The web version was re-built and published under a new link so you can [try it
in your browser][bounty_bros_webgame].

You can read the full update in the [Blog Post][bounty_bros].

## Learning Material Updates

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [egui]

![egui](egui.gif)

[egui] by [@emilk] is an easy-to-use immediate mode GUI library in pure Rust.

This month [version 0.12] of egui was released, with improved plots,
multitouch, user memory stores, window pivots, and more.

You can try out egui in the [online demo].

### [naga]

![Dota2 running on Naga](gfx-dota2-naga.jpg)

Naga is a shader translation library in pure Rust, aiming to replace
glsl-to-spirv and SPIRV-Cross.

In April the gfx-rs team shared a glimpse of the performance difference with
SPIRV-Cross on a single pipeline creation. In May, they did a full-fledged
Dota2 run on [gfx-portability] without SPIRV-Cross. All shader translation was
done by [naga], roughly 4x as fast as the C++ alternative
(with no pipeline caching involved). Read more on [gfx-naga-blog].

### [rafx]

![Rafx Wireframe Demo](rafx-wireframe-demo.jpg)
_Demo with wireframes enabled_

Rafx is a multi-backend renderer that optionally integrates with the
[distill][rafx-distill] asset pipeline.

This month, [@dvd] completed work on the new job system. It implements three
steps: extract, prepare, and write. These jobs are now more structured, making
them easier to implement while supporting concurrent execution and reducing
dynamic allocation. They also integrate with a visibility system to ensure that
off-screen objects are not processed.

[@aclysma] continued work on OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 backends and documented
[implementation details][rafx-implementation-details] of currently available
rendering backends.

Additionally, some rendering features were improved and added: mesh rendering
now uses an instance-rate vertex buffer instead of per-object uniforms,
improving performance. Rendering features now support wireframe and untextured
rendering modes. An egui render feature was added, and the demo now uses egui
instead of imgui.

### [Bevy Retro][bevy_retro]

![ui-example](bevy-retro.gif)
_Bevy Retro UI example_

[Bevy Retro][bevy_retro] is a [Bevy] plugin designed for making pixel-perfect
games as easily as possible.

This project was released under the [Katharos License][katharos_license]. This
license has moral and ethical implications that you may or may not agree with,
so please read it before making use of this project.

In the last two months Bevy Retro has gained a few new features, the biggest of
which being an integration with the [RAUI]  UI library ( also featured in this
newsletter ), allowing you to design fully-fledged user interface for Bevy Retro
games. Additional features added were:

- A simple sound playing API
- Text rendering for the BDF font format
- Custom render hook support allowing you to use raw [Luminance] API calls to render
  anything you want into the low-resolution framebuffer

You can ask questions or give feedback for Bevy Retro
[on GitHub](https://github.com/katharostech/bevy_retro/discussions).

### [Texture Generator]

![A tilemap with procedural textures](texture-generator.png)
_A preview to version 0.5 with furniture_

[Texture Generator] by [Orchaldir] is a library to generate textures,
and a library to use those textures to render tilemaps.
Both libraries can generate color & depth images and
support post processing effects like lighting & ambient occlusion.
For randomness the instance id (e.g. the 145th brick) and/or the tile id are hashed.

The [current release] focuses on furniture.

### [bevy_asset_loader]

![Configuring two asset collections](bevy_asset_loader.png)

`bevy_asset_loader` by [@nikl_me] is a plugin for [Bevy][bevy] apps aiming to
improve a common pattern for asset-loading. The boilerplate required to load
assets during a "loading state" is reduced to a minimum. At the same time, the
plugin brings together the internal names of assets and their filepath, making
it easier to add new assets and to keep an overview over already existing ones.

The library introduces the `AssetCollection` trait that can be derived. Any
number of asset collections can be loaded by a single `AssetLoader` during a
configured app state. When all assets are loaded, the collections will be
inserted into Bevy's ECS as resources. Afterwards, the `AssetLoader` will
switch into a second configurable app state. At this point, your app can use
the asset collections that now contain loaded asset handles.

Currently, a single file always corresponds to one asset and more complex
assets like e.g. `TextureAtlas` are not yet supported. There are plans to
extend the `asset` attribute to allow loading more complex assets. Stay tuned!

### [Nestadia][nestadia]

![Zelda running on Nestadia](nestadia.png)

[Nestadia][nestadia] by [@zer0x64], [@junior-n30] and [@CBenoit] is a
server-based NES emulator.

Nestadia was written as a reverse engineering and memory exploitation challenge
for NorthSec CTF 2021, a cybersecurity competition. Contestants were required to
reverse-engineer the emulator and ultimately write a Tool Assisted Speedrun to
run arbitrary code inside a provided ROM.

After the competition, the code was open-sourced and cleaned up to remove
references to the competition. The developers intend on fixing more bugsand
adding more features in the near future.

Some interesting features of this emulator are its server-based nature, and the
no_std core which means that the emulator can be built and ran pretty much
anywhere without much work.

Incoming improvements include online multiplayer, sound, a WASM port, porting to
a libretro core, and using wgpu instead of sdl for the native GUI and debugger.
