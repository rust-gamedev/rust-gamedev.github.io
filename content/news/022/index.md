### [Veloren][veloren]

![Airship](veloren.jpg) _The beginning of an exciting journey_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

Veloren's 3rd birthday was at the end of May, on the 25th! During the month,
lots of systems were overhauled. Music changes were made to only play certain
tracks in certain areas. Econsim was optimized, and many bugs were fixed. The
minimap was overhauled, with many quality-of-life and visual improvements.
Terrain compression speed was worked on, with many trials of different
compression techniques.

The large physics overhaul was merged, and lots of patches are being added to
issues that popped up from it. You can see a small flight in action
[here][veloren-glider]. Dungeons have been balanced, and many weapons have also
seen changes. In June, 0.10 will be released.

### [A/B Street]

![Most of West Seattle has poor access to public libraries](abstreet.png)

[A/B Street] by [@dabreegster] is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
support for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage. The project aims to engage
more citizens with transportation planning, letting people advocate for real
changes they want to see.

In May, travel time stopped being the only "score" for how well road changes
work. Risk exposure of cyclists crossing dangerous intersections or travelling
in front of high-speed traffic is now measured, with lots of data visualization
work by Michael. Trevor also revived the 15-minute isochrone tool, finding
areas of a city without easy access to education, hospitals, or other
facilities. We also moved the map import process, with over 100 supported maps,
to the cloud from a single poor laptop. OpenStreetMap importing now handles
multiple turn lanes, U-turns, and stop signs much better.

### [The Process]

![Animated image showing a small factory in the middle of the game island](the_process.gif)
_This factory has never looked livelier!_

[The Process] by @setzer22 is an upcoming game about factory building, process
management and carrot production, built with Rust using the Godot game engine!

This month has been focused on improving the game's UI and extending the machine
logistics system, but there was also room for a few cosmetic improvements:

- Improved visualization of connections in the [logistic
  network](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1391484080798281728).
- Implemented configurable filters for machines to build a [sorting
  machine](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1392894719311613953)!
- New materials and [terrain
  shader](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1396175924652019718).
- [Trees and dynamically updating
  grass](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1399774534417498121) using
  instanced rendering.

_Click the image to play the game in your browser!_

[Bounty Bros.][bounty_bros] is a prototype game, similar to the old Legend of
ZeldaÂ® games, developed by [Katharos Technology][katharostech] as a testing
ground for a future commercial game.

The last two months of development was primarily focused on sound and user
interface:

- Music will play in different areas of the map and fade in when walking into
  an area with different music.
- In-game UI is now functional including a new start menu and a simple settings
  menu to toggle the CRT filter and pixel aspect ratio.
- The web player now has a simple loading icon instead of a solid black screen.

### Harvest Hero & Harvest Hero Origins

![Harvest Hero Origins supports local multiplayer](./hho.gif)

Harvest Hero is currently on hold for now. After
[Gemdrop Games] was formed, it was decided
that [Emerald] needed to be tested to ensure it can withstand cross
publishing.
This means creating a smaller game in the
engine in order to figure out the publishing process for
Steam, Itch, Nintendo Switch, and guarantee its viability.

This resulted in the birth of [Harvest Hero Origins], a small wave
defense arcade game with local co-op! Join the [Gemdrop Games Discord]
to stay up to date with these games.

Features:

- Story Mode
- Survival Mode (with local co-op)
  - Unlockable skins
  - 2 unlockable playable characters

the bottom exit of the puzzle](outer-wonders.gif)

[Outer Wonders] is a colorful, pixel art, puzzle-based adventure game
developed by [Utopixel] where you play as Bibi, a cute round monkey who
enjoys rolling in straight lines. Explore a whimsical nature where
altering the environment is key to progress, and solve puzzles to protect
its wonders.

Outer Wonders can be downloaded for Linux and Windows from [itch.io][ow-itchio].

May was mostly dedicated to code cleaning, small improvements, as well as
blogging and community building. Updates of the month include:

- Refactored UI code to streamline menu stacking and ease the implementation
  of an upcoming options menu.
- Added support for menu navigation using the D-Pad alongside the existing
  analog stick support.
- Published a blog post about building Outer Wonders for Linux/itch.io
  ([english][ow-bp-english], [french][ow-bp-french]).
- Posted weekly puzzles [#16][ow-p16], [#17][ow-p17], [#18][ow-p18] and

### [Theta Wave]

[![Blast Repeller](theta-wave.gif)][Theta Wave]
_The Blast Repeller item pushes blasts away from the player_

[Theta Wave] is an open-source space shooter game by developers [@micah_tigley] and
[@carlosupina]. It is one of the showcase games for the [Amethyst Engine]. In
the past month, the ["Loot"] update was released which enhanced how loot drops
are rolled, spawned, and how their effects are applied to the game. The Loot Update
also added an attraction system that allows for entities to repel or attract
other entities.

Now an ["Organization"] update is in progress for Theta Wave. This update will
divide Theta Wave into two workspaces; a library and a binary. This update will also
add documentation comments for all of the library's features.

### [Nestadia][nestadia]

![Zelda running on Nestadia](nestadia.png)

[Nestadia][nestadia] by @zer0x64, @junior-n30 and @CBenoit is a
server-based NES emulator.

Nestadia was written as a reverse engineering and memory exploitation challenge
for NorthSec CTF 2021, a cybersecurity competition. Contestants were required to
reverse-engineer the emulator and ultimately write a Tool Assisted Speedrun to
run arbitrary code inside a provided ROM.

After the competition, the code was open-sourced and cleaned up to remove
references to the competition. The developers intend on fixing more bugs and
adding more features in the near future.

Some interesting features of this emulator are its server-based nature, and the
no_std core which means that the emulator can be built and ran pretty much
anywhere without much work.

Incoming improvements include online multiplayer, sound, a WASM port, porting to
a libretro core, and using wgpu instead of sdl for the native GUI and debugger.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Learn WGPU Updated to wgpu 0.8 and WGSL][learn-wgpu-news]

After some GLSL issues trying to update the ["Learn WGPU"][learn-wgpu] tutorial
to version WGPU 0.8, [@sotrh] decided to migrate to WGSL.
This update was a lot of work, but relatively painless.
As a result, `shaderc` is no longer a dependency.

### [State of Rust in Unreal Engine][rust_in_unreal]

[This Reddit post][rust_in_unreal] discusses the current state of using Rust in
the Unreal Engine. It concludes that although there are several ways that Rust
could interact with the engine, all are still forced to use C++ to bootstrap
these operations.

### [2048: Using an event system to reset the game][2048-bevy-youtube]

[![YouTube Card](2048-bevy-reset-game-events.png)][2048-bevy-youtube]

[@chrisbiscardi] published [a video][2048-bevy-youtube] about using Bevy's event
readers and writers to implement a reset game button for a 2048 clone.

The video walks through implementing a "reset game" UI button in Bevy 0.5 by taking
advantage of Bevy's event system for reading and writing a ResetGameEvent. It also
covers recursively despawning entities and sprites.

## Tooling Updates

### [Graphite][graphite-repo]

![Piet Mondrian's artwork replicated in Graphite using the new color picker](graphite-piet.png)
_Piet Mondrian's artwork replicated in Graphite using the new color picker_

Graphite ([GitHub][graphite-repo], [Discord][graphite-discord],
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/GraphiteEditor)) is an in-development vector and
raster graphics editor built on a nondestructive node-based workflow.

In the past month, new frontend features have mostly closed the gap for a
visually complete UI while a major Rust backend refactor took place.

A new frontend system for floating menus was added to draw menus over the UI,
like dropdown menu input widgets and popovers to display the new color picker.
Also, the application menu bar was built with working buttons for the new Undo
and Export SVG actions.

A large refactor in the Rust backend created a simpler communication strategy
between all components in the software stack and a standard method of handling
user inputs.

[Try it right now in your browser.][graphite-live-demo] Graphite is making
rapid progress towards becoming a non-destructive, procedural graphics editor
suitable for replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. Please
[join the Discord][graphite-discord] - and consider asking for a tour of the
code and how you can help!

### [naga]

![Dota2 running on Naga](gfx-dota2-naga.jpg)

Naga is a shader translation library in pure Rust, aiming to replace
glsl-to-spirv and SPIRV-Cross.

In April the gfx-rs team shared a glimpse of the performance difference with
SPIRV-Cross on a single pipeline creation. In May, they did a full-fledged
Dota2 run on [gfx-portability] without SPIRV-Cross. All shader translation was
done by [naga], roughly 4x as fast as the C++ alternative
(with no pipeline caching involved). Read more on [gfx-naga-blog].

### [rafx]

![Rafx Wireframe Demo](rafx-wireframe-demo.jpg)
_Demo with wireframes enabled_

Rafx is a multi-backend renderer that optionally integrates with the
[distill][rafx-distill] asset pipeline.

This month, [@dvd] completed work on the new job system. It implements three
steps: extract, prepare, and write. These jobs are now more structured, making
them easier to implement while supporting concurrent execution and reducing
dynamic allocation. They also integrate with a visibility system to ensure that
off-screen objects are not processed.

[@aclysma] continued work on OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 backends and documented
[implementation details][rafx-implementation-details] of currently available
rendering backends.

Additionally, some rendering features were improved and added: mesh rendering
now uses an instance-rate vertex buffer instead of per-object uniforms,
improving performance. Rendering features now support wireframe and untextured
rendering modes. An egui render feature was added, and the demo now uses egui

_Bevy Retro UI example_

[Bevy Retro][bevy_retro] is a [Bevy] plugin designed for making pixel-perfect
games as easily as possible.

This project was released under the [Katharos License][katharos_license]. This
license has moral and ethical implications that you may or may not agree with,
so please read it before making use of this project.

In the last two months, Bevy Retro has gained a few new features, the biggest of
which is an integration with the [RAUI]  UI library ( also featured in this
newsletter ), allowing you to design a fully-fledged user interface for Bevy Retro
games. Additional features added were:

- A simple sound playing API
- Text rendering for the BDF font format
- Custom render hook support allowing you to use raw [Luminance] API calls to render
  anything you want into the low-resolution framebuffer

### [Texture Generator]

_A preview to version 0.5 with furniture_

[Texture Generator] by [Orchaldir] is a library to generate textures,
and a library to use those textures to render tilemaps.
Both libraries can generate color & depth images and
support post-processing effects like lighting & ambient occlusion.
For randomness, the instance id (e.g. the 145th brick) and/or the tile id are hashed.

The [current release] focuses on furniture.

### [bevy_asset_loader]

![Configuring two asset collections](bevy_asset_loader.png)

`bevy_asset_loader` by [@nikl_me] is a plugin for [Bevy][bevy] apps aiming to
improve a common pattern for asset-loading. The boilerplate required to load
assets during a "loading state" is reduced to a minimum. At the same time, the
plugin brings together the internal names of assets and their filepath, making
it easier to add new assets and to keep an overview over already existing ones.

The library introduces the `AssetCollection` trait that can be derived. Any
number of asset collections can be loaded by a single `AssetLoader` during a
configured app state. When all assets are loaded, the collections will be
inserted into Bevy's ECS as resources. Afterwards, the `AssetLoader` will
switch into a second configurable app state. At this point, your app can use
the asset collections that now contain loaded asset handles.

Currently, a single file always corresponds to one asset, and more complex
assets like e.g. `TextureAtlas` are not yet supported. There are plans to
extend the `asset` attribute to allow loading more complex assets. Stay tuned!

### [tobj][tobj]

`tobj` by [@Twinklebear] and [@virtualritz] is a simple and lightweight
option for loading OBJ files. `tobj` was originally written inspired by
[@syoyo]'s tinyobjloader, to provide a similar lightweight and easy to integrate
API for loading OBJ files in Rust.

While initially targeted at realtime rendering applications, `tobj` has gained
more advanced importer functionality required for offline rendering,
simulation, and modeling applications, through recent work by [@virtualritz].
These features provide support for merging vertices to avoid discontinuities
in simulation packages and reordering vertices to allow omitting the
index buffer. These features have been added while preserving the original
lightweight API design goal of `tobj`, making it a useful crate for a range of
applications loading with OBJ files.

### [Libfive][libfive]

![CSG difference operation with a sphere and three cylinders](libfive.png)

`libfive` by [@virtualritz] is a safe, oxidized wrapper around
[Matt Keeter][@mkeeter]'s [`libfive`][libfive-orig] â a "library and set of
tools for solid modeling especially suited for parametric and procedural
design".

`libfive` is based on [functional representation][f-rep] (f-rep). F-reps can be
evaluated as 3D meshes with aribitrary precision.

One could e.g. use this for a compact definition of a game's levels and mesh
them adaptively, on the fly, during loading. With a density suitable for the
machine/GPU running the game.

F-reps can also be sliced into polylines/vectors or bitmaps â e.g. for deriving
[level sets][level-set] or for SLA/DLP 3D printing.

### [nvtx-rs]

_Watching the profile in NVIDIA NSight Systems_

NVIDIAÂ® Tools Extension SDK (NVTX) is a C-based API for annotating events,
code ranges, and resources in your applications.
[nvtx-rs] by [@simbleau] is a safe rust wrapper for it.

The intent is to safely wrap the NVTX library in rusty fashion
to provide a proper cross-platform library for GPU and CPU profiling.
Ideally this library would be used in benchmarking rust applications
and performing research on rust projects such as a GPU analysis
with zero-cost abstraction.
