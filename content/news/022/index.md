Welcome to the 22nd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Airship](veloren.jpg) _The beginning of an exciting journey_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

Veloren's 3rd birthday was at the end of May, on the 25th! During the month,
lots of systems were overhauled. Music changes were made to only play certain
tracks in certain areas. Econsim was optimized, and many bugs were fixed. The
minimap was overhauled, with many quality-of-life and visual improvements.
Terrain compression speed was worked on, with many trials of different
compression techniques.

The large physics overhaul was merged, and lots of patches are being added to
issues that popped up from it. You can see a small flight in action
[here][veloren-glider]. Dungeons have been balanced, and many weapons have also
seen changes. In June, 0.10 will be released.

### [naga]

![Dota2 running on Naga](gfx-dota2-naga.jpg)

Naga is a shader translation library in pure Rust, aiming to replace
glsl-to-spirv and SPIRV-Cross.

In April the gfx-rs team shared a glimpse of the performance difference with
SPIRV-Cross on a single pipeline creation. In May, they did a full-fledged
Dota2 run on [gfx-portability] without SPIRV-Cross. All shader translation was
done by [naga], roughly 4x as fast as the C++ alternative
(with no pipeline caching involved). Read more on [gfx-naga-blog].

### [Nestadia][nestadia]

![Zelda running on Nestadia](nestadia.png)

[Nestadia][nestadia] by [@zer0x64], [@junior-n30] and [@CBenoit] is a
server-based NES emulator.

Nestadia was written as a reverse engineering and memory exploitation challenge
for NorthSec CTF 2021, a cybersecurity competition. Contestants were required to
reverse-engineer the emulator and ultimately write a Tool Assisted Speedrun to
run arbitrary code inside a provided ROM.

After the competition, the code was open-sourced and cleaned up to remove
references to the competition. The developers intend on fixing more bugsand
adding more features in the near future.

Some interesting features of this emulator are its server-based nature, and the
no_std core which means that the emulator can be built and ran pretty much
anywhere without much work.

Incoming improvements include online multiplayer, sound, a WASM port, porting to
a libretro core, and using wgpu instead of sdl for the native GUI and debugger.
