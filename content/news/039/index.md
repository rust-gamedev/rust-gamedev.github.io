Welcome to the 39th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### miam

![A screenshot of miam, the player is reproducing a burger order
while the chef is changing the menu](miam.png)

[miam] ([GitHub][miam-src]) by [yopox], [on100balec], and [hadri]
is a cooking game made for the Ludum Dare 51.
"miam" is the French interjection for "yum".

The theme of the game jam was "Every 10 seconds".
Here instead of having 10 seconds to make a burger,
the chef is really indecisive and comes to change
the menu every 10 seconds.

The game was built using Bevy 0.8 with [bevy_game_template]
to save precious time when starting the game jam.
[bevy_tweening] was also really useful to polish the game.

The game was ranked 120th overall and 94th for audio out of 1240 jam entries.

### [Turn-based strategy game (ThousandthStar's devlog)]

![Skeleton](skeleton.png)

[ThousandthStar] ([Gihutb](https://github.com/ThousandthStar/multiplayer_game)) is creating a simple turn-based strategy game using the Bevy game engine. It's a 
small side project he's been building in his spare time.

The game aims to be a cross between chess and the game [Clash Mini](https://clash.com). Players move
their troops around the board and try to get them to their opponent's side. The game is far from playable,
but here is some of the progress that has been done:

- Server and client troop information exchange through packets.
- Threads to allow for multiple games to run at the same time.
- Tile selection appears when troops are clicked.

WIP:
- Troop movement.
- Troop attacks.

The game uses an extremely simple 8x pixel art style. The palette is the [Paper Pixels](https://lospec.com/palette-list/paper-pixels) with some extra colors.

## Engine Updates

### [Fyrox]

![Fyroxed](fyroxed.gif)

[Fyrox] ([Discord][fyrox_discord], [Twitter][fyrox_twitter]) is a game engine that
aims to be easy to use and provide a large set of out-of-the-box features. In October
it hit version 0.28 which added new functionality and improved existing:

- Asset preview during instantiation (see the gif above).
- Improved and deterministic script processing.
- Scripts are now compatible with saved games.
- Major text box widget improvements.
- Prefab property inheritance via reflection.
- Automatic node handle mapping via reflection.
- Sprite sheet animation support.
- Multi-borrow context to solve borrowing issues.
- Editor now stores list of recently used files, scene settings, and more.
- World Viewer now allows you to change a node type.
- Major [book] improvements.
- See the full list of changes in the [blog post][0.28].

### [presser]

[presser] ([GitHub][presser-github], [docs.rs][presser-docs])
by [@fu5ha] ([Embark Studios][embark])
is a crate to help you copy things into raw buffers without
invoking spooky action at a distance (undefined behavior).

Ever done something like this?

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
#[repr(C)]
struct MyDataStruct {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}

let my_data = MyDataStruct { a: 0, b: 42 };

// ðŸš¨ MyDataStruct contains 3 padding bytes after `a`, which are
// uninit, therefore getting a slice that includes them is UB!
let my_data_bytes: &[u8] = transmute(&my_data);

// allocate an uninit buffer of some size
let my_buffer: MyBufferType = some_api.alloc_buffer_size(2048);

// ðŸš¨ this is UB for the same reason, these bytes are uninit!*
let buffer_as_bytes: &mut [u8] =
    slice::from_raw_parts(my_buffer.ptr(), my_buffer.size());

// ðŸš¨ this is UB because not only are both slices invalid,
// this is not ensuring proper alignment!
buffer_as_bytes.copy_from_slice(my_data_bytes);
```

[presser] can help.

```rust
// borrow our raw allocation as a presser::Slab, asserting we have
// unique access to it. see the docs for more.
let slab = unsafe { raw_allocation.borrow_as_slab(); }

// now we may safely copy `my_data` into `my_buffer`,
// starting at a minimum offset of 0 into the buffer
let copy_record = presser::copy_to_offset(&my_data, &mut slab, 0)?;
```

If you're not convinced this is actually an issue, read more in the
[crate readme][presser-readme]. If you're intrigued and want to know more,
see the [docs][presser-docs].
