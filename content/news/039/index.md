Welcome to the 39th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### miam

![A screenshot of miam, the player is reproducing a burger order
while the chef is changing the menu](miam.png)

[miam] ([GitHub][miam-src]) by [yopox], [on100balec], and [hadri]
is a cooking game made for the Ludum Dare 51.
"miam" is the French interjection for "yum".

The theme of the game jam was "Every 10 seconds".
Here instead of having 10 seconds to make a burger,
the chef is really indecisive and comes to change
the menu every 10 seconds.

The game was built using Bevy 0.8 with [bevy_game_template]
to save precious time when starting the game jam.
[bevy_tweening] was also really useful to polish the game.

The game was ranked 120th overall and 94th for audio out of 1240 jam entries.

### [Jumpy]

_Online Game Fish Selection Screen_

[Jumpy] ([GitHub][Jumpy], [Discord][jumpy_discord], [Twitter][jumpy_twitter]) by
[Spicy Lobster][spicy_lobster] is a pixel-style, tactical 2D shooter with a fishy
theme.

In the last month,
the devs started [rewriting][jumpy_rewrite] Jumpy to use the [Bevy] game engine.
Massive progress has been made,
establishing foundational features such as input mapping, UI, and localization,
along with the addition of a few major features:

- Network play, complete with a matchmaking server for joining public games online.
- A scripting engine using TypeScript/JavaScript powered by [`bevy_mod_js_scripting`].
- A revamped map editor that renders the actual game in the viewport.
  This lets you switch back and forth between editing and playing,
  and has the potential for multiplayer map editing in the future.

The physics have been ported from the old version of the game
with the basic gameplay and the sword item nearly finished.
The next tasks include porting some of the old items to the new scripting system
and finishing off the map editor's editing functionality.

### [CyberGate][cybergate-yt]

![State Syncronization](cybergate.gif)
_The health bar that is closer updates more frequently_

CyberGate ([YouTube][cybergate-yt], [Discord][cybergate-dis]) by CyberSoul
is an attempt to use artificial intelligence to build diverse universe experiences
with strange creatures and procedural gameplay styles.

Recent updates:

- Constructed powerful and extremely fast synchronization for states:
  - Able to Extract and Merge partial changes of components and global states.
  - Restrict visibility, if the state is conditionally decided to be private.
  - Limit the frequency of these state updates based on object priority.
- Big improvement of the organization of the networking systems
- Improved timers in 70 places, resulting in higher performance and flexibility
- Better health bars
- Several minor game content fixes

### [presser]

[presser] ([GitHub][presser-github], [docs.rs][presser-docs])
by [@fu5ha] ([Embark Studios][embark])
is a crate to help you copy things into raw buffers without
invoking spooky action at a distance (undefined behavior).

Ever done something like this?

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
#[repr(C)]
struct MyDataStruct {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}

let my_data = MyDataStruct { a: 0, b: 42 };

// ðŸš¨ MyDataStruct contains 3 padding bytes after `a`, which are
// uninit, therefore getting a slice that includes them is UB!
let my_data_bytes: &[u8] = transmute(&my_data);

// allocate an uninit buffer of some size
let my_buffer: MyBufferType = some_api.alloc_buffer_size(2048);

// ðŸš¨ this is UB for the same reason, these bytes are uninit!*
let buffer_as_bytes: &mut [u8] =
    slice::from_raw_parts(my_buffer.ptr(), my_buffer.size());

// ðŸš¨ this is UB because not only are both slices invalid,
// this is not ensuring proper alignment!
buffer_as_bytes.copy_from_slice(my_data_bytes);
```

[presser] can help.

```rust
// borrow our raw allocation as a presser::Slab, asserting we have
// unique access to it. see the docs for more.
let slab = unsafe { raw_allocation.borrow_as_slab(); }

// now we may safely copy `my_data` into `my_buffer`,
// starting at a minimum offset of 0 into the buffer
let copy_record = presser::copy_to_offset(&my_data, &mut slab, 0)?;
```

If you're not convinced this is actually an issue, read more in the
[crate readme][presser-readme]. If you're intrigued and want to know more,
see the [docs][presser-docs].
