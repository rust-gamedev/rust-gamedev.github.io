Welcome to the 33rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Rust GameDev Meetup

![Gamedev meetup poster](gamedev-meetup.png)

The 15th Rust Gamedev Meetup took place in April. You can watch the
recording of the meetup [here on Youtube][gamedev-meetup-video]. The meetups
take place on the second Saturday every month via the [Rust Gamedev Discord
server][rust-gamedev-discord] and are also [streamed on
Twitch][rust-gamedev-twitch]. If you would like to show off what you've been
working on at the next meetup on [May 14th][rust-meetup-time], fill out

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea][wor]

![way of rhea capsule image](wor-capsule.jpg)

[Way of Rhea][wor] is a puzzle adventure with hard puzzles and forgiving
mechanics being produced by [@masonremaley][wor-mason-remaley] in a custom Rust
engine. It has a demo available [on Steam][wor].

Way of Rhea was recently [shown off at PAX East!][wor-pax] A
[minor patch][wor-update] has been released to the demo with post-PAX fixes:

- An issue that made the last puzzle in the third forest level difficult to
navigate with a controller was worked around
- Colliders in the Hermes puzzle were fixed (previously you cold land on top of
a gate if you held left while sliding)
- The attract mode that was used at PAX has been merged (not in demo)
- More jungle biome scenery has been placed (not in demo)
- A crash at startup on CPUs that don't support the `andn` instruction was fixed
(part of the BMI extension to x64)
- The game can now generate mini dumps on Windows and Linux in the event that it
crashes and if given consent, forward them to the developer for analysis

You can stay up to date with the latest Way of Rhea developments by

### BITGUN

![BITGUN gameplay](bitgun-release-optimized.gif)
_BITGUN gameplay_

[BITGUN] ([Discord], [Twitter]) by [@darth] and [@shosanna]
is an action roguelite zombie shooter with difficult and
satisfying combat you can learn and master.
Guns break quickly and you lose all your gear when you die.

The game was just released on Steam!
It has been developed by a programming duo
called LogLog Games.
They have been working on it for the past year and it is
their biggest game so far (they also have 2 smaller games).
[BITGUN] is writen in Godot Engine but it is using
Rust language extensively (it has around 7500 lines of Rust
and 4200 lines of GDScript).

The main changes from the demo version of the game:

- New missions added with extra difficulty
- Improved AI which doesn't just chase the player but behaves unpredictably
- New zombie types - ranged zombie, big spider, zombie spawner
- Added comic-book style story
- Improved tutorial and new player experience
- Reworked inventory system with simplified armor

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Riding at night](veloren.jpg)
_Out for a ride at night_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

For April Fool's day, Veloren made a post about a new direction; [Need for
Voxels: Veloren Cart][veloren-cart]. Enjoy the read! Veloren also participated
in Reddit's /r/place, and got a small place right below /r/rust. Several months
of project finances were processed, and [discussed in a blog
post][veloren-finances]. The [Veloren Reading Club saw its 8th
episode][veloren-reading-club-8], which was on the topic of graphics and
particles. A [second Veloren Code Review session][veloren-code-review-2] was
held, in which two developers went through a merge request that focused on
combat numbers.

Work was done to improve how loadouts work, specifically surrounding inheritance
from other configs. Tweaks were made to arthropods, which should make them more
fun to fight. Work is being done to prepare for the 0.13 release, with a custom
map being built, and a special treasure map being created for the launch party.
Player bank storages are being developed, which will allow players to store
excess items in towns.

### Oasis of Lost Hope

![Oasis of Lost Hope](oasis-of-lost-hope.jpg)

Oasis of Lost Hope is a game where fertile ground is steadily consumed by dark,
barren land called blight. Water helps defend an area from being consumed, but
reserves are finite. The player needs to collect ore to build more irrigation
towers and delay doom for a few more seconds. Yet one thing is certain: the
days of fertile land are counted.

The game is an entry for the Ludum Dare 50 Jam, the theme of which was "Delay
the Inevitable". It has been developed by setzer22 and Bromeon and
[open-sourced on GitHub][oasis-gh]. The game is built on top of godot-rust
alongside GDScript. The Rust language is not exactly known for fast
prototyping, but with a slightly less safety-conservative fork of godot-rust,
the game jam experience was surprisingly smooth. When modeling mechanics such
as the expanding blight or the water pipe network, Rust really showed its
strength as a strongly typed and fast language.

- [Compute shader / pipeline specialization: Bevy's flexible shader system was ported to compute shaders, enabling hot-reloading, shader defs, and shader imports][bevy-compute]
- [Render to texture: cameras can now be configured to render to a texture instead of a window][bevy-render-texture]
- [Flexible mesh vertex layouts in shaders][bevy-vertex]
- [ECS improvements: Order systems using their names, Query::many_mut, use conflicting parameters in systems via ParamSets, WorldQuery derives][bevy-ecs]
- [Documentation improvements: better examples, more doc tests and more coverage][bevy-docs]
- [More audio control: pause, volume, speed, and looping][bevy-audio]
- [Power usage options to enable only updating Bevy Apps when input occurs][bevy-power]

### Dims

![dims foliage](dims.jpg)
_Foliage rendering in Dims_

Dims is an open world creation platform.

In their latest [dev log][dims-dev-log] they
demonstrate a new foliage rendering and spawning system, which automatically
spawns foliage and trees based on "habitat rules". This means a user
can simply "paint" a world and it will get populated with plants and rocks
automatically.

They are also planning to host a screenshot competition in the next few weeks
for anyone who would like to try out the platform and create their own
landscapes. Sign up for the newsletter on their website to get notified when
it starts!

### [Eldiron]

![Eldiron Image](eldiron_screen.png)
_Behavior Nodes of Eldiron_

[Eldiron] ([GitHub](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron), [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZrNj6baSZU),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkusMoenig)) by [@markusmoenig](https://github.com/markusmoenig)
is a creator for classic role playing games (RPGs) written in Rust.

Eldiron v0.5 features inbuild tile maps, a node based behavior system
and region editors.

Development Updates in April:

- Support for 4 layers of tiles for game regions.
  This enables transparency and support for top-down and isometric views.
- Game regions can now contain named areas.
- Areas can contain behavior nodes to spawn monsters, lay traps or
  displace tiles (for example to open a door).
- New "Systems" module to create behavior for Combat and soon for Crafting,
  Magic and more. System behavior trees can be called from any character.

Eldiron v1 will be able to create any kind of RPG utilizing square tiles,
like the classical Ultima series.

[Vismut] ([GitLab][Vismut], [Zulip][vismut-zulip]) by [@lukors]
will be a procedural texturing tool.

[Version 0.5][vismut-0.5] contains a brand new backend to create a better base
for future improvements. A [blog post][vismut-blog] describes the differences
between the old and the new architecture.

## Library Updates

### [Notan v0.3.0][Notan]

![notan](notan.jpeg)

[Notan] is a simple and portable layer designed to create your own multimedia
apps on top of it without worrying about platform-specific code.

The main goal is to provide a set of APIs and tools that can be used to create
your project in an ergonomic manner without enforcing any structure or pattern,
always trying to stay out of your way. The idea is that you can use it as a
foundation layer or backend for your next app, game engine, or game.

The latest version [v0.3.0] comes with audio support for all platforms
using as default backend [oddio] and [symphonia].
