Welcome to the 33rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea][wor]

![way of rhea capsule image](wor-capsule.jpg)

[Way of Rhea][wor] is a puzzle adventure with hard puzzles and forgiving
mechanics being produced by [@masonremaley][wor-mason-remaley] in a custom Rust
engine. It has a demo available [on Steam][wor].

Way of Rhea was recently [shown off at PAX East!][wor-pax] A
[minor patch][wor-update] has been released to the demo with post-PAX fixes:

- An issue that made the last puzzle in the third forest level difficult to
navigate with a controller was worked around
- Colliders in the Hermes puzzle were fixed (previously you cold land on top of
a gate if you held left while sliding)
- The attract mode that was used at PAX has been merged (not in demo)
- More jungle biome scenery has been placed (not in demo)
- A crash at startup on CPUs that don't support the `andn` instruction was fixed
(part of the BMI extension to x64)
- The game can now generate mini dumps on Windows and Linux in the event that it
crashes and if given consent, forward them to the developer for analysis

You can stay up to date with the latest Way of Rhea developments by

### [Bevy v0.7][bevy-blog]

_Creative Commons 'Stylized mushrooms' scene by QumoDone rendered in Bevy._

[Bevy][bevy] is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is
[free and open source][bevy-git] forever!

Bevy 0.7 was a massive community effort. You can check out the
[full release blog post here][bevy-blog], but here are some highlights:

- [Skeletal animation and mesh skinning][bevy-animation]
- [GLTF animation importing][bevy-gltf]
- [Unlimited* point lights in a scene][bevy-unlimited]
- [Improved clustered forward rendering: dynamic/adaptive clustering and faster, more accurate cluster assignment][bevy-light-opt]
- [Compressed texture support (KTX2 / DDS / .basis): load more textures in a scene, faster][bevy-compressed]
- [Compute shader / pipeline specialization: Bevy's flexible shader system was ported to compute shaders, enabling hot-reloading, shader defs, and shader imports][bevy-compute]
- [Render to texture: cameras can now be configured to render to a texture instead of a window][bevy-render-texture]
- [Flexible mesh vertex layouts in shaders][bevy-vertex]
- [ECS improvements: Order systems using their names, Query::many_mut, use conflicting parameters in systems via ParamSets, WorldQuery derives][bevy-ecs]
- [Documentation improvements: better examples, more doc tests and more coverage][bevy-docs]
- [More audio control: pause, volume, speed, and looping][bevy-audio]
- [Power usage options to enable only updating Bevy Apps when input occurs][bevy-power]

### Dims

![dims foliage](dims.jpg)
_Foliage rendering in Dims_

Dims is an open world creation platform.

In their latest [dev log][dims-dev-log] they
demonstrate a new foliage rendering and spawning system, which automatically
spawns foliage and trees based on "habitat rules". This means a user
can simply "paint" a world and it will get populated with plants and rocks
automatically.

They are also planning to host a screenshot competition in the next few weeks
for anyone who would like to try out the platform and create their own
landscapes. Sign up for the newsletter on their website to get notified when
it starts!

### [Vismut 0.5][vismut-0.5]

![Logo](vismut.png)

[Vismut] ([GitLab][Vismut], [Zulip][vismut-zulip]) by [@lukors]
will be a procedural texturing tool.

[Version 0.5][vismut-0.5] contains a brand new backend to create a better base
for future improvements. A [blog post][vismut-blog] describes the differences
between the old and the new architecture.

## Library Updates

### [Notan v0.3.0][Notan]

![notan](notan.jpeg)

[Notan] is a simple and portable layer designed to create your own multimedia
apps on top of it without worrying about platform-specific code.

The main goal is to provide a set of APIs and tools that can be used to create
your project in an ergonomic manner without enforcing any structure or pattern,
always trying to stay out of your way. The idea is that you can use it as a
foundation layer or backend for your next app, game engine, or game.

The latest version [v0.3.0] comes with audio support for all platforms
using as default backend [oddio] and [symphonia].

[Notan]: https://github.com/Nazariglez/notan
[v0.3.0]: https://github.com/Nazariglez/notan/releases/tag/v0.3.0
[oddio]: https://github.com/Ralith/oddio
[symphonia]: https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia
