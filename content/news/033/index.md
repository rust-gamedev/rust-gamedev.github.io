Welcome to the 33rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Foliage rendering in Dims_

Dims is an open world game/experience creation platform.

In their latest dev log they demonstrate their new foliage rendering and spawning system,
where all a user needs to do is paint terrain and trees and foliage will spawn automatically,
based on some user configable "habitat rules".

They are also planing to host a screenshot competition soon, where anyone will be able
to get access to the platform and get creative. Sign up for their newsletter on their
website to get notified when it starts!
