## Game Updates

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Landscape](veloren_river.png)
_Deer by the riverside_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In September, Veloren hit 5000 commits to the main repo! A privilege escalation
bug was found in the game. It was quickly patched, and a PSA was sent out to
notify server owners of its presence. A Discord bot was created to help manage a
testing server. Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, saw the release of version
0.4.0. Lots of work is going on to improve the state of Veloren's server
infrastructure. A stress test was run with 15 players to see how smaller server
could handle running the game.

Improvements were made to the chunk compression which resulted in a ~7x memory
reduction in their storage. The settings menu has been overhauled, along with
many other elements of the UI. A stone golem boss was merged, adding a new boss
to dungeons. Work has been done on beam weapons and collisions, resulting in a
significantly improved healing sceptre.

![Healing sceptre](veloren_night.png)
_A reprise from hunting at night_

In October, Veloren will keep pushing towards more scalable infrastructure.
Tests are happening to move towards a Kubernetes cluster to manage more
infrastructure from code. Optimizations will keep coming in as we find places to
improve. 0.8 may release sometime this month, however, the exact date is yet to
be set.

  but the new syntax sugar is a joy to use, and the backend is even faster now.
- The Greedy Voxel algorithm was significantly improved.
- OBJ models are now supported - useful for things like tree/vegetation geometry,
  which can now use a stylized low-poly graphic without the added weight
  of a bunch of cubes.
- Palette-based rendering - the output system is now constrained
  to a 256 color palette, mostly to play with stylized 3D rendering.
- New format for data files that combines multiple RON objects in one place.

### [OpenGL Preprocessor for Rust]

With the full power of Cargo build scripts and [Tera], you can create an advanced
GLSL preprocessor which can generate code conditionally, in loops, and even
inherit code from other templates.

![An OpenGL preprocessor for Rust](opengl_preprocessor.png)

Writing plain GLSL code is uncomfortable, code is quite often is duplicated, libraries
aren't something natural for GLSL (means you can't out of the box do #include "library.glsl").
The last point is especially problematic if some constants actually originate in
your game logic (like the number of player types). Updating these values manually
in your shader code is repetitive and prone to both error and simple forgetfulness.
It's really helpful to build some kind of preprocessor for your GLSL code,
which can include other files, so you can organize your code into manageable chunks.
With the power of [Tera], it's now easy to accomplish.
Because Rust is also often used for web projects, which need a lot of templated
web-pages preprocessing, we can borrow such technology for our needs,
combine it with cargo build scripts and create a compile-time preprocessing tool.

### Rust, Gamedev, ECS, and Bevy

![Bevy hello world code snippet and two game screenshots, one displaying two
blue spheres in a grey canvas and another one displaying a gameboy colored tile
game](ecs-bevy-tutorial.png)

[@hugopeixoto] released a couple of blog posts on ECS and Bevy,
including a tutorial on how to get started.

- The [first part][hugopeixoto-p1] gives us an in depth overview of what ECS.
  It starts with pseudocode for an object oriented approach
  and goes through several iterations until we get to the ECS paradigm.

- The [second part][hugopeixoto-p2] is a tutorial on how to use [bevy],
  a data driven game engine built in Rust.
  It goes over the basic features of the engine,
  using the example presented in the first part.

### [Real-Time Global Illumination in WGPU][gi-post]

[![diff-gi-gif](diff-gi.gif)][gi-post]
_Infinite light bounces in Cornell Box_

[DI2edd] shared his [real-time diffuse global illumination demo on /r/rust_gamedev][gi-post].
It's written in 100% Rust and uses WGPU for graphics, proving that the API
is an excellent choice even for advanced computer graphics applications.

The technique provides real time global illumination for static lambertian
geometry, and is the implementation of the 2017 paper ["Real-time Global
Illumination by Precomputed Local Reconstruction
from Sparse Radiance Probes"](https://arisilvennoinen.github.io/Projects/RTGI/index.html),
which proposes a spherical harmonics-based approach to solve the rendering equation
in real time.

In practice, this means that the expensive light transport calculations are performed
in a precomputation step, which relies on - among others - [embree-rs],
and [nalgebra] to produce a compressed
representation of the scene that is then used for lighting reconstruction at runtime.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [legion v0.3][legion-0-3]

![Benchmarks](legion_violin.png)

[Legion][legion] is among Rust's fastest and most powerful ECS libraries.
After months in development, v0.3 has finally been released to crates.io.
This is a huge release amounting to a near total rewrite of the library
and a major step towards a stable 1.0 release.

[Check out the v0.3 announcement post][legion-0-3]
for an overview of the new API and all the updates.

The project's repo has also been moved to the Amethyst org
to reflect its close collaboration with the Amethyst community.

### [Thunderdome]

[Thunderdome] is a ~~gladitorial~~ generational arena library inspired by
[generational-arena], [slotmap], and [slab]. It provides constant time
insertion, lookup, and removal via small (8 byte) keys that stay 8 bytes when
wrapped in `Option<T>`.

Data structures like Thunderdome's `Arena` store values and return keys that can
be later used to access those values. These keys are stable across removals and
have a generation counter to solve the [ABA Problem].

```rust
let mut arena = Arena::new();

let foo = arena.insert("Foo");
let bar = arena.insert("Bar");

assert_eq!(arena[foo], "Foo");
assert_eq!(arena[bar], "Bar");

arena[bar] = "Replaced";
assert_eq!(arena[bar], "Replaced");

let foo_value = arena.remove(foo);
assert_eq!(foo_value, Some("Foo"));

// The slot previously used by foo will be reused for baz.
let baz = arena.insert("Baz");
assert_eq!(arena[baz], "Baz");

// foo is no longer a valid key.
assert_eq!(arena.get(foo), None);
```

### [Fontdue]

[Fontdue] is a simple, no_std, pure Rust, TrueType & OpenType
font rasterizer and layout tool.
It strives to make interacting with fonts as fast as possible,
and currently has the lowest end to end latency for a font rasterizer.

Fontdue depends on [ttf-parser] for parsing fonts,
which supports a wide range of TrueType and OpenType features.

A non-goal of this library is to be allocation free and have a fast,
"zero cost" initial load.
Fontdue does make allocations and depends on the alloc crate.
Fonts are fully parsed on creation and relevant information is stored
in a more convenient to access format.
Unlike other font libraries, the font structures have no lifetime dependencies
since it allocates its own space.

Project's roadmap:

- v1.0: fontdue is designed to be a replacement for
  rusttype, ab_glyph, parts of glyph_brush, and glyph_brush_layout.
  This is a class of font libraries that don't tackle shaping.
- v2.0: Shaping - the complex layout of text such as Arabic and Devanagari
  \- will be added.
  There are two potential pure Rust libraries (allsorts or rustybuzz)
  that are candidates for providing a shaping backend to Fontdue,
  but are relatively immature right now.

### [audir]

[audir] is a low level audio library supporting Windows (WASAPI), Linux (Pulse)
and Android (OpenSLES & AAudio).

It aims at providing a minimal and mostly unsafe but feature-rich API on top of
common audio backends with focus on gaming applications. The initial release
version 0.1.0 provides basic recording and playback support for all available
backends, including a small music player example!

Currently looking into coupling with [dasp] for dsp audio graphs to provide
a higher level entry point.

### [Crevice]

[Crevice] is a library that helps define GLSL-compatible (std140) structs for
use in uniform and storage buffers. It uses new `const fn` capabilities
stabilized in [Rust 1.46.0] to align types with explicitly zeroed padding.

Crevice depends heavily on [mint] to support almost any Rust math library. It
also contains helpers for safely sizing and writing buffers, making dynamic
buffer layout a breeze.

```rust
#[derive(AsStd140)]
struct MainUniform {
    orientation: mint::ColumnMatrix3<f32>,
    position: mint::Vector3<f32>,
    scale: f32,
}

let value = MainUniform {
    orientation: cgmath::Matrix3::identity().into(),
    position: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].into(),
    scale: 4.0,
};

upload_data_to_gpu(value.as_std140().as_bytes());
```

### [FemtoVG]

![femtovg](femtovg.png)

[FemtoVG] is a 2D canvas API in Rust, based on [nanovg].

Currently, FemtoVG uses OpenGL as a rendering backend. A Metal backend is 95%
done, and a wgpu backend is on the roadmap. The project is definitely looking
for contributors.

Unlike NanoVG, FemtoVG has full text-shaping support thanks to harfbuzz.

FemtoVG, just like the original NanoVG, is based on the _stencil-then-cover_
approach presented in [GPU-accelerated Path Rendering][gpupathrender.pdf].

### [gfx-rs] and [gfx-portability]

![gfx-rs logo](gfx-logo.png)

[gfx-portability] is a Vulkan portability implementation based on [gfx-rs].
It's basically a drop-in implementation of Vulkan on top of Metal and D3D12,
useful on platforms that don't have native Vulkan support, or have buggy drivers.

It released version [0.8.1](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability/releases/tag/0.8.1)
with official support for the new [KHR portability extension][khr-portability],
as well as a few other extensions, plus a number of correctness fixes.

gfx-rs team asks Rust users of Vulkano, Ash, and other Vulkan-only wrappers to try
out the gfx-portability as a solution on macOS and relevant Windows 10 platforms.

In [gfx-rs] itself, the DX12 backend, and the descriptor indexing feature support
got improved. There has been a push to get DX11 backend in a solid shape,
and it can now run [vange-rs] pretty well 🎉.

### [Riddle]

[Riddle] is a Rust media library in the vein of SDL,
building as far as possible on the most active/standard Rust libraries
(winit, wgpu, image, etc). Riddle is deliberately not an engine, or a framework.
It is a library devoted to exposing media related features in a unified way while
avoiding prescribing program structure. It provides abstractions over windowing,
input, audio, image loading/manipulation and provides a basic wgpu based 2D
renderer.
The [docs][riddle-docs] contain runnable examples for most methods and types.

The goal is to provide a stable foundation, resilient to developments in the Rust
gamedev ecosystem, on which games, custom engines, and other media applications can
be built.

### [Bracket-Lib]

[bracket-lib] (previously `rltk_rs`) by [@blackfuture]
is a Rust implementation of [C++ Roguelike Toolkit][rltk-cpp].

Bracket-lib is going through a stability pass, focusing on freezing the API.
It will be featured in the author's upcoming book:
*Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play*.
The book should be going into early access/beta in time for the next newsletter.

### [Bevy Engine v0.2][bevy-0-2]

[![bevy logo](bevy_logo.png)][bevy]

[Bevy][bevy] is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust.
It is [free and open source][bevy-repo] forever!

This month, thanks to 87 contributors, 174 pull requests, and their
[generous sponsors][bevy-sponsors], Bevy 0.2 was released. You can view the
[full Bevy 0.2 announcement here][bevy-0-2]. Here are some highlights:

- Async Task System: Bevy now has a brand new async-friendly task system,
  which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might
  have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also provides the
  flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority.
  This new task system completely replaces Rayon and the cpu usage wins were huge!
- Initial Web Platform Support: (A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using
  WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to
  input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This
  is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a
  number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound.
- Parallel Queries: Systems that use queries already run in parallel,
  but before this change the queries themselves could not be iterated in parallel.
  Bevy 0.2 adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel, which builds on
  top of the new Async Task System.
- Transform System Rewrite: Bevy's old transform system used separate
  `Translation`, `Rotation`, and `Scale` components as the "source of truth",
  which were then synced to a `LocalTransform` component after each update. There
  are Good Reasons™ to use this approach, but it created a "lag" between the
  calculated LocalTransform and the source components and dataflow between components
  is hard to reason about. This problem was resolved by making a newer, simpler
  transform system that uses a consolidated `Transform` type.  
- Joystick/Gamepad Input: The Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support
  for most controllers thanks to the gilrs library!
- Bevy ECS Performance Improvements: generational entity IDs,
  read-only queries, lock-free world APIs, direct component lookup.

Community plugin updates:

- [bevy_rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier):
  Rapier Physics' official Bevy plugin was updated to support Bevy 0.2.
- [bevy_ninepatch](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_ninepatch):
  Display 9-Patch UI elements, where you can specify how
  different parts of a PNG should grow.
- [bevy_mod_picking](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking): 3d cursor
  picking and highlighting.
- [bevy_contrib_colors](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_contrib_colors):
  A simple color library.
- [bevy_input_map](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_prototype_input_map):
  Converts user inputs from different input hardware into game specific actions.
  Ex: keyboard "Space" or joystick "A" can be mapped to a "Jump" Action.
- [bevy_prototype_lyon](https://github.com/Nilirad/bevy_prototype_lyon):
  Draw 2D shapes, like triangles, circles, and beziers.
- [bevy_contrib_inspector](https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy-contrib-inspector):
  Visually edit fields of your bevy resources in a browser or native view.
