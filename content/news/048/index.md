Welcome to the 48th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Colony]

![tiled map with lots of grass and trees, some resources
and a couple of named pawns](colony.png)

[Colony] by [@ryankopf] is a colony simulator game built with Bevy that
is open source and is in a pre-alpha stage. Similar to other colony simulator games
like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld, there are units that have their own traits and
can be instructed to perform tasks like farming and chopping trees.

You can have your units build things, farm stuff, and explore, and the game is soon
to be moving onto adding more content and UI, as core features are being completed.

_Game HUD is now more complete_

Open Combat ([Website][OpenCombat_website], [GitHub][OpenCombat_github],
[Discord][OpenCombat_discord]) is a real-time tactical game
which takes place during the 2nd World War.

Some major changes this month:

- HUD has been filled with a minimap and squad informations.
- Multiple issues about zoom and move on map has been fixed.
- A high definition map has been created.

Some fixes and improvements have to be done, but the devs are near
to publishing the official demo of the game!
