Welcome to the 48th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Colony]

![tiled map with lots of grass and trees, some resources
and a couple of named pawns](colony.png)

[Colony] by [@ryankopf] is a colony simulator game built with Bevy that
is open source and is in a pre-alpha stage. Similar to other colony simulator games
like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld, there are units that have their own traits and
can be instructed to perform tasks like farming and chopping trees.

You can have your units build things, farm stuff, and explore, and the game is soon
to be moving onto adding more content and UI, as core features are being completed.
