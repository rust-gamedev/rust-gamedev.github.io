Welcome to the 48th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Colony]

![tiled map with lots of grass and trees, some resources
and a couple of named pawns](colony.png)

[Colony] by [@ryankopf] is a colony simulator game built with Bevy that
is open source and is in a pre-alpha stage. Similar to other colony simulator games
like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld, there are units that have their own traits and
can be instructed to perform tasks like farming and chopping trees.

You can have your units build things, farm stuff, and explore, and the game is soon
to be moving onto adding more content and UI, as core features are being completed.

### [tiny-snake.rs]

![tiny-snake.rs running in the terminal](tiny_snake.gif)

[tiny-snake.rs] by [@Rodrigodd] is a terminal snake game, with a minimal binary
size.

The entire game is implemented in a single file of pure Rust code, with zero
dependencies. All interactions with the system are done through raw syscalls
(so it only runs on Linux, sorry) and the program is completely panic-free
(panic handling increases the binary size by almost 4KiB).

The game can be compiled using a single `rustc` command, and the resulting
binary is only 2760 bytes.

### [8bit Duels][8bit-gh]

![Screenshot featuring the new enemiy: the crow](8bit-duels-game.png)

[8bit Duels][8bit-gh] ([Discord][8bit-dis]) is a turn-based strategy game made
by [@ThousandthStar]. It has been in development for the past year,
and the release is right around the corner!
A new blog post along with a release Youtube video is coming soon
on [this channel][8bit-yt].

This month's update includes a completely remade user interface.
The [devlog][8bit-devlog] covers the change from the [bevy_ui] crate
to [belly], which provides a nice HTML-like syntax for building the UI.
The last devlog post will address the re-implemented UI and the new troop: the Crow!

The Crow, as seen in the screenshot above, is a hooded bird assassin with two daggers.
It can attack twice per turn, dealing 2 damage each time. The Crow is the last of
the five 8bit Duels characters.

### [Ant Colony Simulation][antsim]

![TODO: better desc](bevy-ants-simulation.png)

[Ant Colony Simulation][antsim] depicts an ant colony where the ants
have a simple task: to find food and bring it back to the colony.
To achieve this goal, they use signals called pheromones.
These pheromone signals guide the ants to the food source and back to their colony.

[@BonesaiDev][bonesai-yt] released a couple of videos about the project:

- [An overall explanation][antsim-vid-expl] of how it works.
- [A timelapse][antsim-vid-timelapse] of ant colony at 5x speed.
- [2D Bloom showcase timelapse][antsim-vid-timelapse-bloom] with 1k ants.

The project is written using Bevy.
You can find the source code [on GitHub][antsim].

## Learning Material Updates

### Mobile development with Bevy

[@Nikl][nikl] spent some time developing a mobile game using Bevy and
documented findings on his [blog][nikls-blog]. [A first post][android-bevy-post]
contains notes on general project setup and some Android specific solutions.

GitHub workflows were created for automatic builds.
[A guide on how to set up an iOS workflow][ios-workflow] was released at
the end of July.

## Tooling Updates

### [Rerun][rerun]

![Rerun showing a large 3D point cloud](rerun.png)

[Rerun][rerun] ([Discord][rerun-dis], [Github][rerun-gh]) is an open-source SDK
for logging complex visual data paired with a visualizer for exploring that data
over time. While its primary focus is on robotics and computer vision, it can be
useful for all kinds of rapid prototyping & algorithm development.

[v0.8.0][rerun-v0-8-0] and subsequently [v0.8.1][rerun-v0-8-1] are out now!

A few of the biggest highlights:

- Pinhole logging is now easier to use in many cases.
- The visualizer can now show coordinate arrows for all affine transforms
  within the view.
- Users that build their own Viewer applications can now add fully custom Space Views.
- New optional flush_timeout specifies how long Rerun will wait if a TCP stream
  is disconnected during a flush.
- The `RecordingStream` now offers a stateful time API, similar to the Python APIs
- Defaults to 8ms long microbatches instead of 50ms. This makes the default behavior
  more suitable for use-cases like real-time video feeds.
- The web viewer now incremental loads .rrd files when streaming over HTTP. #2412

There's a growing community on [Discord][rerun-dis] waiting for you to join in
case you have any questions, comments or just want to follow the latest
development. The [Github project][rerun-gh] is MIT/Apache licensed and open to
contribute for everyone, be it with suggestions, bugs or PRs.

## Library Updates

### [bevy_xpbd]

![Balls held by string swinging and hitting each other in a Newton's cradle](bevy_xpbd.gif)
_Newton's cradle simulated using bevy_xpbd_

[bevy_xpbd] by [@Jondolf] is a 2D and 3D physics engine based on
Extended Position Based Dynamics for the Bevy game engine.
It uses Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS) directly for the simulation data
and logic, which makes the design and API feel better integrated into Bevy while
avoiding the overhead associated with copying lots of data to a separate data
structure like in many other physics engines such as bevy_rapier.

In mid-July, bevy_xpbd 0.2 was released, featuring:

- Spatial queries (ray casting, shape casting, point projection, intersection tests);
- Bevy 0.11 support;
- Improved scheduling;
- Velocity damping;
- Gravity scale;
- Locking translational and rotational axes;

and much more. You can find more details in the
[release post][bevy-xpbd-post] and [changelog][bevy-xpbd-changelog].

A lot of work was also done during the rest of July. The physics debug renderer
was improved, collision stability issues were significantly reduced, external
impulses were added, and Bevy's own `Transform`s can now be used directly
for moving bodies. The narrow phase part of collision detection was also
refactored into a separate plugin, which makes multithreading and several
upcoming features much easier to implement while also improving modularity.

### [Sparsey]

[Sparsey] by [@LechintanTudor] is a fast and flexible Entity Component System
based on sparse sets.

The latest release, v0.11.0, improves the performance of adding and removing
components from entities and adds new functions for running systems that only
borrow data from one of `World`, `Resources` or `SyncResources`.

### [Hanabi]

![Glowing particles circling and raising up](hanabi.gif)
_Hanabi effect entirely simulated on GPU thanks to the new Expression API of v0.7_

The [Hanabi] library ([GitHub][hanabi-github], [docs.rs][hanabi-docs]) is a
modern VFX library for the [Bevy game engine][bevy]. It focuses on scale to produce
stunning visual effects (VFX) in real time, offloading most of the work to
the GPU (compute shaders), with minimal CPU intervention. The design is inspired
by modern particle systems found in other industry-leading game engines.

This month, [Hanabi] saw its biggest release so far.
Version 0.7 of Hanabi not only brings support for Bevy 0.11,
but also adds a whole new Expression API
to provide a new level of customizing for VFX authors.
With expressions, developers can combine simple building blocks
like simulation parameters (`time`, `delta_time`),
effect properties (user-defined variables controlled from CPU),
and math operators (`add`, `mul`, `cos`, ...),
to directly modify each attribute of a particle (position, velocity, ...)
and form complex behaviors with complete control.
The expression API complements and extends the existing `Modifier`-based workflow
to achieve even more complex effects.

This release also marks a major stepping stone
toward the ability to build a visual editor (node graph)
to build and tweak visual effects in real time.

Other changes include the ability to set a screen-space size for particles,
and a new `KillSphereModifier` to confine particles
to the inside or the outside of a sphere.
See the [CHANGELOG][hanabi-changelog] for all details.
