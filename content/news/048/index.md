Welcome to the 48th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [8bit Duels]

[8bit Duels] is a turn-based strategy game made by [ThousandthStar]. It has been
in development for the past year, and the release is right around the corner!
A new blog post along with a release Youtube video is coming soon on [this channel].

This month's update includes a completely remade user interface. The [devlog] I
made covers my change from the `bevy_ui` crate to the `belly` crate, which provides
a nice `html`-like syntax for building the UI. My last devlog post will address the
re-implemented UI and the new troop: the Crow!

The Crow, as seen in the screenshot above, is a hooded bird assassin with two daggers.
It can attack twice per turn, dealing 2 damage each time. The Crow is the last of
the five 8bit Duels characters.
