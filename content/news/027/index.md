Welcome to the 27th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Lonely Star]

![Lonely Star screenshot](lonely-star.png)

[Lonely Star] is a 2D 'endless runner' game by [@17cupsofcoffee], featuring
simple generative music. It was built with [Tetra] back in February 2020,
for Weekly Game Jam 135.

This month, it was made [open-source][lonely-star-source], and received a
small update to improve the UI and fix a few bugs.
