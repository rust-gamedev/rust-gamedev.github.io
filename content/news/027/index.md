Welcome to the 27th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [The Process]

![An animated gif showing an engineer shooting rockets](the_process.gif)
_Firing Carrockets‚Ñ¢!_

[The Process] by @setzer22 is an upcoming game about factory building, process
management, and carrot production, built with Rust using the Godot game engine!

For the past two months the project has seen some slow but steady progress. Work
has started towards a simple combat system that will have the engineers fighting
hordes of robots to defend their factories.

This month the game has seen the following changes and improvements:

- New assets like
  [a robot enemy](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1436722776186966023)
  (concept by @Kath_Art_ic, modelling by @mkdirsrc),
  [a shoulder mounted gun](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1439970905220960259)
  and
  [new machine icons](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1455232744573788162).
- A new system to attach armor-like models to in-game characters.
- Foundations of a combat system.
- Carrockets‚Ñ¢! ü•ïüöÄ [(1)](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1445098719326658562)

### [LibraCity] - city planning on a needle!

![LibraCity screenshot](libracity.png)

[LibraCity] is a puzzle city planning game by [@djeedai] where you need to build
a city while balancing it on a needle (the center of the board). It was built for
[Ludum Dare 49] using the [Bevy Engine], and is a first-time use of the engine.

Post-jam, a webassembly version was added and published, which now allows
[playing the game online](https://djeedai.github.io/libracity/).

The code source is freely [available on GitHub](https://github.com/djeedai/libracity).

### [Chaos Theory] - gamified double pendulum simulator

![Chaos Theory Gif](chaos-theory.gif)

[Chaos Theory] is a tiny HTML5 game by [@necauqua] where you can draw and
simulate pendulums with a few goals and restrictions per level.
It was done for [Ludum Dare 49][Chaos Theory] with a help of a small custom
engine with Rust being compiled to WASM and drawing shapes to an HTML5 canvas.

You can play the game [online][chaos-theory-online], and the source code
is available [here][chaos-theory-src] and
[here][chaos-theory-engine-src].

### [Lonely Star]

![Lonely Star screenshot](lonely-star.png)

[Lonely Star] is a 2D 'endless runner' game by [@17cupsofcoffee], featuring
simple generative music. It was built with [Tetra] back in February 2020,
for Weekly Game Jam 135.

This month, it was made [open-source][lonely-star-source], and received a
small update to improve the UI and fix a few bugs.

### [Graph Game]

![image/gameplay of the game: circle and triangles](graph_game.gif)
_Navigating the graph map can be stressful_

[Graph Game] ([GitHub][graph-game-github])
uses [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as its engine. You can play it from your
[browser](https://vrixyz.github.io/graph_nav/) - click on colored triangles,
guess the rules and survive as long as possible!

Development has just begun, and the future of the project is not clear -
the developer welcomes you to come and discuss next steps on the game's
[Discord server][graph-game-discord].

## Engine Updates

### [All is Cubes][All is Cubes] 0.3.0

[![Screenshot of All is Cubes][all-is-cubes-screen]][all-is-cubes-screen]

All is Cubes ([GitHub][All is Cubes], [Crates.io][all-is-cubes-cr]) by [kpreid]
is a game/engine for worlds made of blocks made of voxels. It is intended to be
usable both as an engine or rendering library, or as a game with built-in
editor/programming functionality (genre(s) to be determined). While the project
is still highly incomplete and API-unstable, the 0.3.0 release marks a lot of
now-usable functionality ([changelog][all-is-cubes-changelog]):

- UI: mouselook, multiple example scenes, inventory with stacks, and rendering
  to image files.
- Simulation/mechanics: character collision against arbitrary voxel shapes,
  much-improved light propagation, transactional state updates (all-or-nothing,
  internally order-independent), and ‚Äúbehaviors‚Äù attached to game objects for
  scripting/animation.
- Rendering: high-voxel-count blocks (incomplete, but usable for text as seen in
  the above screenshot), ‚Äúsmooth lighting‚Äù (interpolated across faces), frustum
  culling, and correct sRGB-versus-linear color handling.

The next planned milestone is saving/loading.

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA, Love2D, and Raylib. After
a few quiet months, version 0.6.6 has been released, featuring:

- A big overhaul of the keyboard API, with better support for international
  layouts
- Lots of new functions for manipulating the game window
- A long-requested [ECS example][tetra-ecs]
- Bugfixes and docs improvements

For more details, see the [changelog][tetra-changelog].

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

## Library Updates

### [wgpu]-0.11 release

![bevy webgl2 via wgpu](bevy-webgl2.png)
_experimental Bevy branch running on WebGL2 via wgpu_

The team is happy to announce the release of wgpu-0.11 and naga-0.7.
Details can be found on the [gfx-rs blog]. The most exciting feature
is WebGL2 support. With some caveats, users no longer need to wait for
WebGPU in the browsers in order to deploy on the Web. Support is still
a bit rough, and patches come out regularly, but most examples work.

@kvark also visited [Rust LA Meetup] to [talk about Naga]
and the history of processing shaders with Rust.

### [hecs_rapier] 0.11.0

[hecs_rapier] is a physics engine for hecs ECS.
It is a direct port of [bevy_rapier2d].

Recent development added joints and physics_hooks support.
This makes `hecs_rapier` feature complete, with `bevy_rapier2d` feature parity.
