Welcome to the 27th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [LibraCity] - city planning on a needle!

![LibraCity screenshot](libracity.png)

[LibraCity] is a puzzle city planning game by [@djeedai] where you need to build
a city while balancing it on a needle (the center of the board). It was built for
[Ludum Dare 49] using the [Bevy Engine], and is a first-time use of the engine.

Post-jam, a webassembly version was added and published, which now allows
[playing the game online](https://djeedai.github.io/libracity/).

The code source is freely [available on GitHub](https://github.com/djeedai/libracity).

### [Lonely Star]

![Lonely Star screenshot](lonely-star.png)

[Lonely Star] is a 2D 'endless runner' game by [@17cupsofcoffee], featuring
simple generative music. It was built with [Tetra] back in February 2020,
for Weekly Game Jam 135.

This month, it was made [open-source][lonely-star-source], and received a
small update to improve the UI and fix a few bugs.

### [Graph Game]

![image/gameplay of the game: circle and triangles](graph_game.gif)
_Navigating the graph map can be stressful_

[Graph Game] ([GitHub][graph-game-github])
uses [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as its engine. You can play it from your
[browser](https://vrixyz.github.io/graph_nav/) - click on colored triangles,
guess the rules and survive as long as possible!

Development has just begun, and the future of the project is not clear -
the developer welcomes you to come and discuss next steps on the game's
[Discord server][graph-game-discord].

## Engine Updates

### [All is Cubes][All is Cubes] 0.3.0

[![Screenshot of All is Cubes][all-is-cubes-screen]][all-is-cubes-screen]

All is Cubes ([GitHub][All is Cubes], [Crates.io][all-is-cubes-cr]) by [kpreid]
is a game/engine for worlds made of blocks made of voxels. It is intended to be
usable both as an engine or rendering library, or as a game with built-in
editor/programming functionality (genre(s) to be determined). While the project
is still highly incomplete and API-unstable, the 0.3.0 release marks a lot of
now-usable functionality ([changelog][all-is-cubes-changelog]):

- UI: mouselook, multiple example scenes, inventory with stacks, and rendering
  to image files.
- Simulation/mechanics: character collision against arbitrary voxel shapes,
  much-improved light propagation, transactional state updates (all-or-nothing,
  internally order-independent), and “behaviors” attached to game objects for
  scripting/animation.
- Rendering: high-voxel-count blocks (incomplete, but usable for text as seen in
  the above screenshot), “smooth lighting” (interpolated across faces), frustum
  culling, and correct sRGB-versus-linear color handling.

The next planned milestone is saving/loading.

### [Tetra] 0.6.6

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA, Love2D, and Raylib. After
a few quiet months, version 0.6.6 has been released, featuring:

- A big overhaul of the keyboard API, with better support for international
  layouts
- Lots of new functions for manipulating the game window
- A long-requested [ECS example][tetra-ecs]
- Bugfixes and docs improvements

For more details, see the [changelog][tetra-changelog].

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

## Library Updates

### [wgpu]-0.11 release

![bevy webgl2 via wgpu](bevy-webgl2.png)
_experimental Bevy branch running on WebGL2 via wgpu_

The team is happy to announce the release of wgpu-0.11 and naga-0.7.
Details can be found on the [gfx-rs blog]. The most exciting feature
is WebGL2 support. With some caveats, users no longer need to wait for
WebGPU in the browsers in order to deploy on the Web. Support is still
a bit rough, and patches come out regularly, but most examples work.

@kvark also visited [Rust LA Meetup] to [talk about Naga]
and the history of processing shaders with Rust.

### [hecs_rapier] 0.11.0

[hecs_rapier] is a physics engine for hecs ECS.
It is a direct port of [bevy_rapier2d].

Recent development added joints and physics_hooks support.
This makes `hecs_rapier` feature complete, with `bevy_rapier2d` feature parity.

### [godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust)

![godot-rust logo](godot-rust.png)

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.

Recent developments have added [foundational support to async][gd-async] 
that enables users to make use of the Rust async runtimes with the Godot Engine
(thanks to chitoyuu for the PR).

In addition to the foundational support, lyonbeckers was kind enough to
include a [new recipe in the User Guide][gd-async-recipe] that covers
how to configure async with `tokio`.

The team also merged several smaller bug fixes in [#791][gd-791], [#795][gd-795],
and [#800][gd-800] and is making steady progress towards version 0.10.0.

Finally, the team has recently added [third party project][gd-book-projects] 
section in the book to help promote games, applications, and libraries/tools
that are working with godot-rust. If you have a project that you would like to
be included, please feel free to reach out to our team and we'd be happy
to include it.
