Welcome to the 27th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [The Process]

![An animated gif showing an engineer shooting rockets](the_process.gif)
_Firing Carrockets‚Ñ¢!_

[The Process] by @setzer22 is an upcoming game about factory building, process
management, and carrot production, built with Rust using the Godot game engine!

For the past two months the project has seen some slow but steady progress. Work
has started towards a simple combat system that will have the engineers fighting
hordes of robots to defend their factories.

This month the game has seen the following changes and improvements:

- New assets like
  [a robot enemy](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1436722776186966023)
  (concept by @Kath_Art_ic, modelling by @mkdirsrc),
  [a shoulder mounted gun](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1439970905220960259)
  and
  [new machine icons](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1455232744573788162).
- A new system to attach armor-like models to in-game characters.
- Foundations of a combat system.
- Carrockets‚Ñ¢! ü•ïüöÄ [(1)](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1445098719326658562)

### [LibraCity] - city planning on a needle!

![LibraCity screenshot](libracity.png)

[LibraCity] is a puzzle city planning game by [@djeedai] where you need to build
a city while balancing it on a needle (the center of the board). It was built for
[Ludum Dare 49] using the [Bevy Engine], and is a first-time use of the engine.

Post-jam, a webassembly version was added and published, which now allows
[playing the game online](https://djeedai.github.io/libracity/).

The code source is freely [available on GitHub](https://github.com/djeedai/libracity).

### [Berry Run]

![berry](berrycover.png)

[Berry Run] is a bad game by [@bombfuse_dev] built on top of
[Emerald Engine], follow them on twitter, they're cool.

"Dodge the babies (no kids, no babies), evade the grannies
(they're heading to the grand canyon),
and don't touch belf (belf is sacred).
Also a bunch of dunces left their logs and rocks lying around,
better not to touch those, it would be rude to touch someone's logs and rocks."

_Can you handle this unstable ride?_

[Me And My Unicycle] is a 2D physics game by [@nikl_me] submitted to Ludum
Dare 49. It is build with [Bevy] and [the code can be found on GitHub][mamu-source].

Following the LD49 theme "unstable", the game is about riding a unicycle
with challenging controls. Try making it through each level without falling.

All assets are self-made. The developer had a lot of fun recording audio and
sound effects!

## Engine Updates

### [All is Cubes][All is Cubes] 0.3.0

[![Screenshot of All is Cubes][all-is-cubes-screen]][all-is-cubes-screen]

All is Cubes ([GitHub][All is Cubes], [Crates.io][all-is-cubes-cr]) by [kpreid]
is a game/engine for worlds made of blocks made of voxels. It is intended to be
usable both as an engine or rendering library, or as a game with built-in
editor/programming functionality (genre(s) to be determined). While the project
is still highly incomplete and API-unstable, the 0.3.0 release marks a lot of
now-usable functionality ([changelog][all-is-cubes-changelog]):

- UI: mouselook, multiple example scenes, inventory with stacks, and rendering
  to image files.
- Simulation/mechanics: character collision against arbitrary voxel shapes,
  much-improved light propagation, transactional state updates (all-or-nothing,
  internally order-independent), and ‚Äúbehaviors‚Äù attached to game objects for
  scripting/animation.
- Rendering: high-voxel-count blocks (incomplete, but usable for text as seen in
  the above screenshot), ‚Äúsmooth lighting‚Äù (interpolated across faces), frustum
  culling, and correct sRGB-versus-linear color handling.

The next planned milestone is saving/loading.

### [Tetra] 0.6.6

[Tetra] is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA, Love2D, and Raylib. After
a few quiet months, version 0.6.6 has been released, featuring:

- A big overhaul of the keyboard API, with better support for international
  layouts
- Lots of new functions for manipulating the game window
- A long-requested [ECS example][tetra-ecs]
- Bugfixes and docs improvements

For more details, see the [changelog][tetra-changelog].

## Library Updates

### [wgpu]-0.11 release

![bevy webgl2 via wgpu](bevy-webgl2.png)
_experimental Bevy branch running on WebGL2 via wgpu_

The team is happy to announce the release of wgpu-0.11 and naga-0.7.
Details can be found on the [gfx-rs blog]. The most exciting feature
is WebGL2 support. With some caveats, users no longer need to wait for
WebGPU in the browsers in order to deploy on the Web. Support is still
a bit rough, and patches come out regularly, but most examples work.

@kvark also visited [Rust LA Meetup] to [talk about Naga]
and the history of processing shaders with Rust.

### [hecs_rapier] 0.11.0

[hecs_rapier] is a physics engine for hecs ECS.
It is a direct port of [bevy_rapier2d].

Recent development added joints and physics_hooks support.
This makes `hecs_rapier` feature complete, with `bevy_rapier2d` feature parity.

[bevy_rapier2d]: https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier

### [bevy_kira_audio]

[bevy_kira_audio] is a [Bevy] plugin that integrates the audio library [Kira]
into [Bevy] applications.

In the latest version `0.6.0`, you can load files with custom semantic
durations and play looped audio with an intro. The plugin now also cleans up
old sound instances. Following Bevy, [bevy_kira_audio] is now licensed under
dual MIT + Apache 2.0, and the library will no longer crash on systems without
an audio device.

### [bevy_verlet]

![bevy_verlet](bevy_verlet.gif)

[bevy_verlet] is a lib for projects using [Bevy Engine][bv_bevy]
providing a plugin to use [verlet integration][bv_wikipedia]
physics. Very useful for cloth simulation and joints, and less expensive than
complex physics engine, it is a nice addition to 2D or 3D projects. Making good
use of the Entity-Component-System architecture of the bevy engine, any entity
can become a `VerletPoint` and have physics applied to it.

The crate also provides *sticks* which constrains the points in order to create
strings or cloth. With its modularity, you may customize the physics precision
(iterations), the gravity, and the physics time step to use.

New features:

- Query parallel batching and custom batching size
- Global documentation
- Fixed issues with timesteps
- Improved examples

You may contact the author on Twitter at [@ManevilleF][ManevilleF] or join the
[discussion][bv_discussion].

### [Bevy Pen Tool][bevy-pen-tool]

![bevy_pen_tool2](bevy_pen_tool2.gif)

Bevy Pen Tool is a plugin that helps developers make 2D paths using
Bezier curves. Its user interface provides functionality for:

- spawning Bezier curves,
- moving end points and control points of Bezier curves,
- linking individual Bezier curves to each other,
- grouping curves,
- saving and loading paths as look-up tables
    (typically for animations and agent movement),
- generating arbitrary 2D meshes that fill the interior of a path
    using the Lyon crate,
- generating a mesh that follows a path like a road,
- saving meshes and roads in ".obj" format,

A stable version of Bevy Pen Tool should come out as a crate shortly
after Bevy 0.6 shows up. Here is a link to the [repo for more
information][bevy-pen-tool].

### [godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust)

![godot-rust logo](godot-rust.png)

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.

Recent developments have added [foundational support to async][gd-async]
that enables users to make use of the Rust async runtimes with the Godot Engine
(thanks to chitoyuu for the PR).

In addition to the foundational support, lyonbeckers was kind enough to
include a [new recipe in the User Guide][gd-async-recipe] that covers
how to configure async with `tokio`.

The team also merged several smaller bug fixes in [#791][gd-791], [#795][gd-795],
and [#800][gd-800] and is making steady progress towards version 0.10.0.

Finally, the team has recently added a [third party project][gd-book-projects]
section in the book to help promote games, applications, and libraries/tools
that are working with godot-rust. If you have a project that you would like to
be included, please feel free to reach out to the godot-rust team.
