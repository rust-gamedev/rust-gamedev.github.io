Welcome to the 40th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [8bit Duels]

![UI preview](8bd-ui-prev.png)
_UI preview_

[@ThousandthStar] is creating an 8bit themed multiplayer game. It's a turn based strategy
game and is currently under development. This month, the [blog] got moved from [dev.to] to
ThousandthStar's own blog on Github. 

The game is soon getting a UI, and more packets need to be implemented before the game is
ready to play. ThousandthStar is excited for the game to be playable, but it will probably take
some time, since he is doing it as a side project when he has some time. The game is lacking 
troop spawns, a turn system, and some more troops! Any and all ideas posted to the [/r/rust_gamedev] 
thread are greatly appreciated.

If possible, ThousandthStar would like the art to be made up of voxel models instead of just pixel art,
but he doesn't know if he'll reach that point yet.

## Engine Updates

### [Pixel Engine][pixel_engine]

[pixel_engine] by [@Maix0] is a 2D game engine that started as a Rust-version
of olcPixelGameEngine (written in C++). It was used as a learning project
for Maix0, where he worked on it for over 3 years.

This engine has a very straightforward API and is mostly CPU based
(the exception is Decals which are GPU-sprites) but it can achieve some things.
Use it as a way to learn new algorithms or to make a simple game.

It uses [wgpu] underneath so there is support for all desktop targets and WASM
(even though there is a bug in the WASM builds
where the keyboard layout is only QWERTY).

The most recent addition is the [SpriteRef], a way to create a view
inside a sprite where it is possible to draw in it.
You can have multiple non-overlapping views at the same time.

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

### [Boytacean][boytacean]

Boytacean ([Github][boytacean], [Working Emulator][boytacean-web])
by [@joamag] is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust
with both Native (using SDL) and Web (using WebAssembly) frontends that has been
created as a learning experiment to better understand both Rust capabilities and
Game Boy hardware.
The Web frontend is especially interesting making use of Web standards like
[Gamepad API][gamepad-api] to provide a rich and joyful experience for both
desktop and mobile devices.
Performance wise the web version runs smoothly with little to no significant
hardware requirements.

Even though Boytacean supports most Game Boy games and passes most well known
test ROMs there are still some features lacking like support for Game Boy Color
and APU (sound) support.

You can check this [Reddit post][boytacean-red-ann] for more information.
