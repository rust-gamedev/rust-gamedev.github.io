Welcome to the 40th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Pixel Engine

pixel engine ([Github](https://github.com/Maix0/pixel_engine)) by [@Maix0]
is a 2d game engine that started as a rust-version of the olcPixelGameEngine (written in C++). 
It was used as a learning project for Maix0, where he worked on it for over 3 years.

This engine as a very straight forward api and is mostly CPU based (the exeception of Decals which are Gpu-sprite) but it can achieve some things
Use it as a way to learn new algorithms or to make a simple game.

It uses wgpu underneath so there is support for all desktop targets and WASM 
(even though there is a bug in the WASM builds where the keyboard layout is only QWERTY).

The most recent addition is the [SpriteRef](https://docs.rs/pixel_engine/latest/pixel_engine/graphics/struct.SpriteMutRef.html), a way to create a view inside a sprite where it is possible to draw in it. You can have multiple non-overlapping views at the same time.
