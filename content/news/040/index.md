Welcome to the 40th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Space Frontiers

![In-game screenshot of a player pointing a laser gun.](space_frontiers_ingame_screenshot.png)

[Space Frontiers] ([GitHub], [Discord], [Twitter], [Reddit], [Steam Group])
by [Star Wolves] is an online sci-fi action community RPG game simulating
space (and spaceships) in 3D.

The game has been in-development for over two years.
The server and client were successfully prototyped with Godot several
years ago. After that, the server, with all its features, was
successfully ported to [Bevy]. The client is now getting the same
porting treatment!

The project is commercial, [open-source] and has a proprietary license.
There is a milestone for a license change to free open-source.

Space Frontiers seeks to deliver customized community gameplay experiences.
Read more about plugins and content customization in the [development journal].

The official StarWolves.io forum and discussion board were launched a week ago.
The first 50 registrants will receive a permanent unique forum group/title.
