Welcome to the 40th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Boytacean][boytacean]

Boytacean ([Github][boytacean], [Working Emulator][boytacean-web])
by [@joamag] is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust
with both Native (using SDL) and Web (using WebAssembly) frontends that has been
created as a learning experiment to better understand both Rust capabilities and
Game Boy hardware.
The Web frontend is especially interesting making use of Web standards like
[Gamepad API][gamepad-api] to provide a rich and joyful experience for both
desktop and mobile devices.
Performance wise the web version runs smoothly with little to no significant
hardware requirements.

Even though Boytacean supports most Game Boy games and passes most well known
test ROMs there are still some features lacking like support for Game Boy Color
and APU (sound) support.

You can check this [Reddit post][boytacean-red-ann] for more information.
