Welcome to the 40th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Timely Defuse]

"WAVE 5" and a score of 199 appear at the top.](timely-defuse.png)

[Timely Defuse] ([GitHub][timely-defuse-github]) by [@E_net4]
is a mobile Web game using Bevy,
submitted to GitHub Game Off 2022.
In this game, explosives are coming out of nowhere
and it's the hero's job to stop as many of them from exploding as possible.

Some remarks about the experience of creating Timely Defuse
were shared on [Dev.to][timely-defuse-dev].

## Engine Updates

### [Pixel Engine][pixel_engine]

[pixel_engine] by [@Maix0] is a 2D game engine that started as a Rust-version
of olcPixelGameEngine (written in C++). It was used as a learning project
for Maix0, where he worked on it for over 3 years.

This engine has a very straightforward API and is mostly CPU based
(the exception is Decals which are GPU-sprites) but it can achieve some things.
Use it as a way to learn new algorithms or to make a simple game.

It uses [wgpu] underneath so there is support for all desktop targets and WASM
(even though there is a bug in the WASM builds
where the keyboard layout is only QWERTY).

The most recent addition is the [SpriteRef], a way to create a view
inside a sprite where it is possible to draw in it.
You can have multiple non-overlapping views at the same time.

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

### [Boytacean][boytacean]

Boytacean ([Github][boytacean], [Working Emulator][boytacean-web])
by [@joamag] is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust
with both Native (using SDL) and Web (using WebAssembly) frontends that has been
created as a learning experiment to better understand both Rust capabilities and
Game Boy hardware.
The Web frontend is especially interesting making use of Web standards like
[Gamepad API][gamepad-api] to provide a rich and joyful experience for both
desktop and mobile devices.
Performance wise the web version runs smoothly with little to no significant
hardware requirements.

Even though Boytacean supports most Game Boy games and passes most well known
test ROMs there are still some features lacking like support for Game Boy Color
and APU (sound) support.
