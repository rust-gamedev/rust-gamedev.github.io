Welcome to the 21st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [The Process]

_The new test map in The Process_

[The Process] by @setzer22 is an upcoming
game about factory building, process management and carrot production, built
with Rust using the Godot game engine!

Some of the main highlights of the game:

- Automate complex processes by combining machines and programmable workers.
- Obtain materials from a wide variety of natural resources: Even chicken!
- An upbeat, wholesome aesthetic: Factories don't need to be depressing.

This last month was focused on implementing the following features:

- A [test map](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1381648397569036291) to
  ensure all corners of the codebase are working
- Improved player mobility by introducing a 
  [grappling hook](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/mztqhy/added_a_grappling_hook_to_my_game_built_with_rust/)

The game has been in active development for over a year and is now approaching
its first initial playable alpha version. Stayed tuned to the official twitter
for updates!
