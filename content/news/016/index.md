### [Akigi][akigi]

![Akiki butcher](akigi_butcher.jpg)
_Akigi butcher skill_

[Akigi][akigi] is a WIP online multiplayer game.

In November, focus was put on gameplay. Prototyping of a butcher skill was done,
which will allow for animals to be turned into raw resources. Support for
rendering shadows in the MetalRenderer was added, bringing it one step closer to
the WebGlRenderer. Lots of work was put into the ability to fire a bow. This
spanned a few weeks, however enough functionality was added for it to feel like a
solid part of gameplay. It still requires some polish, however, which will be
the focus of the beginning of December.

### [Game Off 2020][go-2020]

![game off logo](gh-gameoff.png)

[Game Off][go-2020] is an annual game jam, where participants spend the month
of November creating games based on a secret theme.

Game Off 2020 theme was "MOONSHOT".
Here are some of the games made with Rust:

- ["War of the Moons"][go-wotm] by [@FrancoisMockers]
  made with [bevy] ([source code][go-wotm-src]).

  > Your goal is to conquer the planet, but it's not possible until you
  > control all the moons. The end result is not completely what I wanted,
  > but it was a nice occasion to try [rapier] for physics and [lyon] to draw
  > shapes from [bevy].

  ![gameplay](go-wotm.png)

- ["Starlight 1961"][go-starlight1961] by [@grzi]
  made with [amethyst] ([source code][go-starlight-src]).

  > A die and retry landing game where you control a spaceship, its fuel and health
  > inside 10 different levels. Each level is made up of enemies (cannons,
  > plasma doors, saw blades, etc.), bonuses (fuel, health) and coins.

  [@grzi] also published a devlog post:
  ["My journey into Github GameOff 2020"][go-starlight-post].

  ![gameplay](starlight-1961.png)

- ["Everfight"][go-everfight] by [@SnoozeTime]
  made with [luminance] ([source code][go-everfight-src]).

  > Battle hordes of human spaceships in order to reach the moon.
  > Wave after wave, the enemy becomes stronger.
  > Unlock infinite mode once you finished the game and try to beat
  > your personal record.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Hands-on Rust][hands-on-rust]

[![Hands-On Rust](hands-on-rust.jpg)][hands-on-rust]

["Hands-on Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play"][hands-on-rust]
by Herbert Wolverson is now in beta. The book teaches Rust through game development
examples, and is targeted at readers who have some experience with writing code
in other languages. It teaches beginner to intermediate-level Rust. It also teaches
high-level gamedev concepts, notably Entity-Component System (ECS) theory.

After walking you through installing Rust, a few simple examples teach the language
basics. Then you put these together to make "Flappy Dragon" - a simple Flappy Bird
clone. The book then changes gear and begins to build a dungeon crawler (roguelike)
with tile graphics. The first beta walks you through the basics, "Flappy Dragon"
and making an ECS-based dungeon crawler skeleton - focused on teaching basic Rust,
ECS composition and control flow. Beta 2 added health, a heads-up display, combat
and win/lose conditions - focused on making the user comfortable with Rust's
amazing iterator system. Beta 3 will add fields-of-view, more dungeon designs and
map theming - focused on teaching trait use and creation.

Beta 1 launched November 11th, Beta 2 launched November 25th. The next beta is
expected December 8th.

### [Why Rust is the Future of GameDev][why-rust-future]

[@thefuntastic] published an article detailing why Rust has the potential
to be significant for the future of programming in games:
the origins of the language, overview of the main technical features,
why Rust's popularity grows, the state of the ecosystem,
main challenges lying ahead, and links
to some Rust gamedev resources and communities.

### [How to Build a Multiplayer Game][talk-dns2utf8-video]

[![A screenshot from the talk](talk-multiplayer-game.jpg)][talk-dns2utf8-video]
_You can [watch the recording here][talk-dns2utf8-video]._

This month, [@dns2utf8] gave a [talk][talk-dns2utf8-video] about
how to build a multiplayer game with actix-web that people with
any modern browser shipping JavaScript, Canvas Context2D and Websocket can play.

> How coding a system with so many independently moving parts is less about
> the bits and bytes but more about the high-level capabilities rust offers.
> In this talk Stefan Schindler @dns2utf8 focused on how he designed
> the whole system from concept to implementation including
> hosting it on a CO2 neutral server.

You can play the MultiPlayer Snake game itself on [mps.estada.ch].

Also, a [follow-up text note][talk-dns2utf8-followup] was released.

### [Learn Wgpu][learn-wgpu]

Development of new tutorial content has slowed down due to wgpu still being in
development. [@sotrh] has committed to continue maintaining the project through
the coming version changes, and plans to add more new content when the API
solidifies. He with the help of other contributors such as GitHub user
[@kanerogers] worked through a series of issues to polish the repository before
the content freeze.
In addition to that he added a [compute pipeline showcase][learn-wgpu-compute]
and an [imgui showcase][learn-wgpu-imgui].

In other news @sotrh has started a [Patreon][@sotrh] to help fund research
and development on the Learn Wgpu site as well as other wgpu related projects.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [cargo-mobile]

[![Bevy's Breakout example running on an iPhone XR](cargo-mobile.jpg)][cargo-mobile]
_Bevy's Breakout example running on an iPhone XR_

[cargo-mobile] is a tool created by [Brainium Studios] to simplify Rust mobile
development. It generates Xcode and Android Studio projects, and provides handy
commands for building and deploying apps to iOS and Android devices.

### [profiling]

This month, [profiling] was released on crates.io. This crate provides a very
thin abstraction over instrumented profiling crates like `puffin`, `optick`,
`tracy`, and `superluminal-perf`.

Mark up your code like this:

```rust
#[profiling::function]
fn some_function() {
    burn_time(5);

    for i in 0..5 {
        profiling::scope!("Looped Operation");
        burn_time(1);
    }
}
```

And get visualizations like this (`optick` and `puffin` shown):

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

It has a handful of features that make it stand out:

- No schema restrictions.
- HashMap support out of the box.
- Trait object support through the [`rkyv_dyn`] crate.
- Validation through the [`bytecheck`] crate, suitable for untrusted and
  potentially malicious data.
- Safe mutable archives with pinning.

Reddit user [vlmutolo] also made a [toy benchmark] comparing rkyv against serde
and bincode and found that rkyv had promising initial numbers:

```text
serialize (bincode):    89 ns/iter
serialize (rkyv):       86 ns/iter

deserialize (bincode):  118 ns/iter
deserialize (rkyv):     16 ns/iter
```

A write-up on the [architecture and internals of rkyv] is also available.

### [assets_manager] v0.4

[assets_manager] provides a convenient way to work with external files, making
resources caching and hot-reloading easy and straightforward.

Version 0.4.0 was released this month, bringing loads of improvements.

- A `Source` trait, to load assets from anywhere. It makes the crate usable in
  WebAssembly.
- Assets that can load other assets, with a transparent integration with
  hot-reloading. Using a manifest file has never been so easy!
- Improved performance.
- See the [full changelog][assets_manager_log] for more information.

### [Terra Mach][terramach]

![Dashboard demo](terramach.gif)
_Terra Mach dashboard demo_

[Terra Mach][terramach] is a mapping frontend system to build graphical interfaces
for devices. It focuses on experiences around statistical data (graphs, diagrams),
mapping, and user input. When it comes to user experience, elements a user
interacts with are flexible enough to build many common experiences. Terra Mach
is highly inspired by Flutter. It leverages graphics library Skia to enable
highly performant 2D graphics.

[terramach]: https://github.com/lykhonis/terramach

### [glam] v0.11.2

[glam] is a simple and fast linear algebra crate for games and graphics.

This month version 0.11.2 was released. There were a number of important changes
since the last newsletter.

The vector accessor methods for setting and getting individual vector elements
were replaced with direct access support. This means that now instead of needing
to use `.x()`, `.set_x(x)` or `.mut_x() = x` the element may be accessed
directly via `.x = x` and so on.

The reason that this was not done originally was that some types are backed by
SIMD types which do not support direct access. For these types direct access is
now supported with `Deref` and `DerefMut` implementations.

The direct access support was added in version 0.10.1 along side the accessor
methods. The accessor methods were deprecated in 0.10.2 and  have been removed
in 0.11.0.

### [winit]

[winit] is a cross-platform window creation and event loop management library.

winit is looking for a new web platform maintainer! If you're
interested, or know anyone who is, you can reach out via the
[tracking issue][winit-call].

### [Fluffl][fluffl]

[Fluffl][fluffl] is a WIP generic media layer for graphics, IO, and audio
for desktop and the browser.

### [Rapier]

[![Rapier logo](rapier-logo.svg)][Rapier]

[Rapier] is a set of 2D and 3D physics engines for games, animation and
robotics written in Rust.

[This month][rapier-november] the version 0.4.0 has been released with
exciting new features:

- the ability to read contact and proximity information from the narrow-phase.
- the ability to lock some translations and/or rotations for a rigid-body
  without using joints.

The following demo shows examples of translation locking (on the blue cuboid)
and rotation locking (full locking on the capsule, partial locking on the
cuboid):

![Rapier features](rapier-demo.gif)

A cross-platform determinism bug appearing on MacOS with the new Apple M1
ARM processor has also been fixed.

The [bevy_rapier] plugin for the Bevy game engine has been updated to support
all the aforementioned features. In addition, it supports:

- the automatic removal of rigid-bodies, colliders, and joints when the entity
  they are attached to are removed from the Bevy ECS.
- the ability to attach multiple colliders to a single rigid-body using Bevy
  Hierarchy.

### [Salva]

[![Salva logo](salva-logo.svg)][Salva]

[Salva] is a set of 2D and 3D particle-based fluids simulation engines for
games and animation written in Rust.

Starting [this month][salva-november] Salva 0.5.0 no longer supports
[nphysics] for simulating rigid-bodies. Instead, it implements two-ways
coupling with [Rapier] (see the
[demo](https://twitter.com/dimforge/status/1329467380158898183)).

In addition to the Rapier integration, it is now possible to query Salva
to retrieve all the fluid particles located inside an AABB. This can be
useful for, e.g., spawning new particles ensuring there isn't anything
there already.

### [rib]

![rib](rib.gif)

Parsing a 3D model file and understanding the different links between bone
matrices, keyframes and vertices is a task that can take a lot of time and
motivation of the developer. On top of that, combining the different bone
transform matrices for the current frame is often error prone.

[rib] is an attempt to tackle these problems and might help you save time.
Current features of [rib] include:

- Support of collada files coming from the latest Blender version.
- Precomputation of the bone matrices expressed in the world space so that you
  just have to pass it to your shader for traditional GPU skinning.
- Interpolation between keyframes.
- (De)/serialization in binary thanks to [bincode].

[rib] can be greatly extended, for example with the support of other format
handling skeleton data, such as the [glTF] format.
Contributions are more than welcome.

### [gfx-rs] and [wgpu]

![gfx-picture](wgpu-big-picture.svg)

The gfx-rs team has published a post ["The Big Picture"][gfx-post] providing
the overview of all projects in the works, and how they are connected to each other.

[wgpu] has moved from [gfx-extras] to the new [gpu-alloc] and [gpu-descriptor]
libraries by [@zakarumych]. These are backend-agnostic, which allows `wgpu`
to now depend on `gfx-hal` directly without intermediates. Patching [gfx-rs]
will now be easier, without the need to release every little change.

Finally, all the latest [wgpu] code has landed into Gecko, and new
features and fixes are implemented in Firefox. That allows it to run
most of the updated [WebGPU samples][wgpu-samples].

  the default [`wgpu`] renderer.
- A trait-based approach to react to mouse and keyboard interactions in the
  `Canvas` widget.
- Basic overlay support, allowing the superposition of interactive widgets on
  top of other widgets.
- A drop-down selector widget built on top of the overlay support.
- A widget that displays a QR code, powered by [`qrcode`].
- Additional internal enhancements, like event capturing and a faster event
  loop.

### [KAS] v0.6 and [KAS-text] v0.2

![KAS markdown](kas-markdown.png)
_Markdown parsing demo_

[KAS] by [@dhardy] is a general-purpose UI toolkit; its
initial aim is "old school" desktop apps with good keyboard and touchscreen
support. Unlike many modern immediate-mode UIs, KAS's widgets retain state,
allowing minimal per-frame updates. KAS supports embedded WebGPU graphics now,
and plans to support embedded usage and additional rendering systems.

[KAS-text] v0.2 saw a significant revision to its API, including support for
rich text (bold, italic, underline, size and some layout improvements).
[KAS] v0.6 pulls in those changes and adds a few fixes and QoL improvements.

[ggez] is a 2D game framework inspired by Love2D. The project is chugging
along getting everything prepared for a 0.6 release at the end of 2020,
and a lot of work has been done in the last month:

- All major dependencies have been updated, including a long-overdue
  update to `winit` 0.23.
- Over a dozen pull requests have been merged, large and small.
- A bunch of old issues have been cleaned up.

Major features to look forward to include far better math performance, a
`MeshBatch` type, better ergonomics on Linux Wayland, and more. There's
lots of work still to be done though. A bunch of issues are out of date
and need triage, docs need to be proofread, and especially examples need
be updated and tested on every platform imaginable. Try out the `devel`
branch and give it a go!

### [bevmnist][bevmnist-itch.io]

![demo of running inferences for all digits](bevmnist.gif)
_Running through all digits_

[bevmnist][bevmnist-itch.io] by [@FrancoisMockers] is a PoC for running
inferences from a neural network in a game made with [bevy], that can run in
WASM (source code on [github][bevmnist-github]).

Using [tract], the goal was to test running neural network inferences from a
game. [MNIST handwritten digits classification][MNIST] is the "hello world" of
neural networks, and has small enough networks available in [onnx] format that
can run in real time in WASM. This project also has github actions that will
build and release a [bevy] game to itch.io for Linux, macOS, Windows and WASM.
