Welcome to the 36th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Engine Updates

### Gamercade

![Gamercade preview](gamercade.gif)
_WASM 3d CPU Rendering On a 2d Fantasy Console?_

[Gamercade] by @RobDavenport is a WASM powered fantasy console focused
on building multiplayer neo-retro games.

After over half a year in development, Gamercade and related tools are ready
for pre-alpha testing. This includes the [console](Gamercade-Console) itself,
as well as the [editor](Gamercade-Editor).

Gamercade's killer feature is ease of developing multiplayer games.
The console is able to simplify networked game development process
in the best way possible: build a local multiplayer game, and get full online
play for free!

The WASM Api features powerful but simple built-in features like input,
2d graphics, random number generation, and more. Limitations do exist, but are 
flexible, such as resolutions up to 1920 x 1080, and a maximum of 256 color 
palettes with up to 64 colors each.

The community around the project is small, but is looking to expand.
Come on over to the [subreddit](Gamercade-Subreddit), or hang out and chat
on [discord](Gamercade-Discord), where the developers interact with members
and post updates daily. The project is newly [open source](Gamercade-Github) and 
looking for contributors, suggestions, as well as awesome game demos.

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been into evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. It's current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add *many* new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!

## Library Updates

### [hecs]

[hecs] is a fast, lightweight, and unopinionated archetypal ECS library.

[Version 0.8][hecs-changelog] marks a breaking change to most methods that
previously took a generic type parameter `T: Component`, replacing them with
methods taking type parameters which must be *references to* component types
instead. This resolves a long-standing footgun where users accustomed to writing
`&T` in queries might write `world.get::<&T>`, interpreted by rustc as
referencing the valid component type `&'static T`, resulting in code that
compiles but fails to access the intended component.
