Welcome to the 36th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_The server and clients are able to smoothly handle
over a thousand balls rained from above_

CyberGate ([YouTube][cybergate-yt], [Discord][cybergate-dis]) by CyberSoul
is a new multiplayer project that aims at procedurally generating destinct
universes and gameplay experiences. CyberGate is the name of the main world
where universes can be created and accessed by quantum portals.

Recent updates:

- Bandwidth became 16 times smaller by implementing entity prioritization
  \+ other techniques.
- Interpolation and Jitter prediction makes entities way smoother.
- Automatic and Reliable Spawn and Despawn of entities.
- Many other features and optimizations to do with rapier 3d physics,
  wgpu renderer and quinn (quic) protocol.

Please, [join our Discord server][cybergate-dis] to participate in tests.

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been into evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. It's current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add *many* new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!

## Library Updates

### [hecs]

[hecs] is a fast, lightweight, and unopinionated archetypal ECS library.

[Version 0.8][hecs-changelog] marks a breaking change to most methods that
previously took a generic type parameter `T: Component`, replacing them with
methods taking type parameters which must be *references to* component types
instead. This resolves a long-standing footgun where users accustomed to writing
`&T` in queries might write `world.get::<&T>`, interpreted by rustc as
referencing the valid component type `&'static T`, resulting in code that
compiles but fails to access the intended component.
