Welcome to the 36th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_The server and clients are able to smoothly handle
over a thousand balls rained from above_

CyberGate ([YouTube][cybergate-yt], [Discord][cybergate-dis]) by CyberSoul
is a new multiplayer project that aims at procedurally generating distinct
universes and gameplay experiences. CyberGate is the name of the main world
where universes can be created and accessed by quantum portals.

Recent updates:

- Bandwidth became 16 times smaller by implementing entity prioritization
  \+ other techniques.
- Interpolation and Jitter prediction makes entities way smoother.
- Automatic and Reliable Spawn and Despawn of entities.
- Many other features and optimizations to do with rapier 3d physics,
  wgpu renderer and quinn (quic) protocol.

### [Botnet]

![botnet screenshot](botnet.png)

[Botnet] is an upcoming programming-based multiplayer game, where you write
scripts (compiled to WebAssembly) to control robots. Coordinate your network
of bots to gather resources, build new industry, and expand your control of
the server!

This month was primarily spent on BotnetReplayViewer - a visual program to
watch matches, and inspect entity data.

Additionally, the antenna structure was added. Building an antenna gives you
control over the bay (room) it's in, letting you build additional structures,
and increasing the total number of bots you can control. Bots can also use
antennas to store resources.

[github discussion page][botnet_ideas] and suggest some ideas!

### [Re-Rolling!]

![Re-rolling gameplay](re-rolling_gameplay.png)

[Re-Rolling!] by [@mystalice](https://twitter.com/mystalice) is a top-down 2D
survival shooter where you fight off a horde of rats using weapons you randomly
rolled.

The game was created for [GMTK Jam 2022][rr_gmtk2022] in 48 hours and was
heavily inspired by [20 Minutes Till Dawn][rr_20minutes].

Re-Rolling! was made with Bevy using heron for physics, bevy_egui for in-game
UI, and a handful of other helpful crates and plugins. You can browse the source
on [GitHub][rr_github].

## Learning Material Updates

### Pathfinding in Rust

![Example of the results of doing an A* search from a start node to a goal node](astar-search.png)

[Pathfinding in Rust: A tutorial with examples](https://blog.logrocket.com/pathfinding-rust-tutorial-examples)
is an article with examples of how to use the [`pathfinding`](https://crates.io/crates/pathfinding)
crate to do breadth-first, Dijkstra's, and A* search. It links to the
[gregstoll/rust-pathfinding](https://github.com/gregstoll/rust-pathfinding)
repo which has working code for all of these.

_Creating mountains from planes with vertex shaders and Bevy_

[@chrisbiscardi] published a [video][chrisbiscardi-vid1]
about using the new Material shader APIs in Bevy 0.8 to transform the
vertex positions in a custom mesh plane using a vertex shader.

_What's in a wgsl fragment shader? ft Bevy_

[@chrisbiscardi] published a [video][chrisbiscardi-vid2]

## Tooling Updates

### [NES Bundler][nes-bundler]

![NES Bundler running Data Man with GUI showing](nes-bundler.png)
_NES Bundler in action_

[NES Bundler][nes-bundler] by [@tedsteen].
Did you make a NES-game but none of your friends own a Nintendo? Don't worry.
Put your ROM and configuration in NES Bundler and build an executable for Mac,
Windows or Linux. What you get is a single executable with

- Simple UI for settings
- Re-mappable Keyboard and Gamepad input (you bundle your default mappings).
- Save/Restore state
- Netplay!

It's early days, but the key features are there and work is ongoing
to make it more mature!

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been into evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. It's current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add *many* new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!

## Library Updates

### [hecs]

[hecs] is a fast, lightweight, and unopinionated archetypal ECS library.

[Version 0.8][hecs-changelog] marks a breaking change to most methods that
previously took a generic type parameter `T: Component`, replacing them with
methods taking type parameters which must be *references to* component types
instead. This resolves a long-standing footgun where users accustomed to writing
`&T` in queries might write `world.get::<&T>`, interpreted by rustc as
referencing the valid component type `&'static T`, resulting in code that
compiles but fails to access the intended component.

[hecs]: https://github.com/Ralith/hecs
[hecs-changelog]: https://github.com/Ralith/hecs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#080

### [bevy_mod_wanderlust]

[bevy_mod_wanderlust]
([GitHub](https://github.com/PROMETHIA-27/bevy_mod_wanderlust)) by
[@PROMETHIA-27] is a character controller plugin for Bevy engine.

Inspired by [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdskE8PJy6Q),
it is implemented on top of [Rapier physics](https://rapier.rs/) and highly
customizable. Wanderlust includes a variety of settings to target many different
character controller types, including 2D/3D platformers, spacecraft, and
first/third person games.

### [Lyon]

![Variable width stroke in action](lyon.png)

[Lyon] ([GitHub](https://github.com/nical/lyon)) by [Nical](https://github.com/nical)
is a collection of crates providing various 2D vector graphics utilities, including
fast tessellation algorithms, easy to integrate in typical GPU accelerated rendering
engines.

Lyon made its symbolic [`1.0.0` release](https://crates.io/crates/lyon/1.0.0)
reflecting the stability of the project. Highlights in this release include:

- Initial support for variable line width in the stroke tessellator.
- An efficient algorithm to query positions at given distances along a path.
- Improved support for specifying custom endpoint attributes in paths and algorithms.
- And more. You can read the [announcement blog post here](https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-1-0.html).

### [Renet]

![GIF of demo using renet and bevy](renet_bevy_demo.gif)
*Demo using renet and bevy*

[Renet] by [@lucaspoffo] is a network library to create
games with the Server-Client architecture.

Built on top of UDP, it has its own protocol to send and receive reliable messages
more suited for fast-paced games than TCP. Some other features are:

- Connection management
- Authentication and encrypted connections
- Communication through multiple types of channels:
  - Reliable Ordered: guarantee ordering and delivery of all messages
  - Unreliable Unordered: no guarantee of delivery or ordering of messages
  - Block Reliable: for bigger messages, such as level initialization
- Packet fragmentation and reassembly

Renet comes with [bevy_renet], a plugin for the Bevy engine, and also with
[renet_visualizer], an egui interface to visualize network metrics.

### [miniquad]

![miniquad fileopen](miniquad_gl2.gif)
*VirtualBox, gl2 as the only GPU accelaration available*

[miniquad] is a safe and cross-platform rendering library
focused on portability and low-end platform support.

This month [OpenGl 2.1/GLESv2][gl2pr] PR got merged, adding support for old
android phones, virtual machines, and just old computers.

While the PR itself is quite small, it solved a very old design issue:
[compatibilities proposal][mqcompat]. Fixing this issue opened the door for
both lower-end backends, like gl1, and higher-level backends. Metal being the
next in line.
