### [Botnet]

![botnet screenshot](botnet.png)

[Botnet] is an upcoming programming-based multiplayer game, where you write
scripts (compiled to WebAssembly) to control robots. Coordinate your network
of bots to gather resources, build new industry, and expand your control of
the server!

This month was primarily spent on BotnetReplayViewer - a visual program to
watch matches, and inspect entity data.

Additionally, the antenna structure was added. Building an antenna gives you
control over the bay (room) it's in, letting you build additional structures,
and increasing the total number of bots you can control. Bots can also use
antennas to store resources.

### [Re-Rolling!]

![Re-rolling gameplay](re-rolling_gameplay.png)

[Re-Rolling!] by [@mystalice](https://twitter.com/mystalice) is a top-down 2D
survival shooter where you fight off a horde of rats using weapons you randomly
rolled.

The game was created for [GMTK Jam 2022][rr_gmtk2022] in 48 hours and was
heavily inspired by [20 Minutes Till Dawn][rr_20minutes].

Re-Rolling! was made with Bevy using heron for physics, bevy_egui for in-game
UI, and a handful of other helpful crates and plugins. You can browse the source
on [GitHub][rr_github].

### [Dims][dims-website]

![Concept art of a player creating a world in Dims](dims-concept-art.jpg)

[Dims][dims-website] ([Twitter][dims-twitter], [Discord][dims-discord],
[YouTube][dims-youtube]) is a pre-alpha collaborative open-world
creation platform.
Users can hop in sessions and build a game together, allowing everyone
to bring out their inner game-maker.

In July, development continued to make great strides. Some of the highlights
include:

- Continued work on the audio system, including in-game graphs of attenuation
  and other audio-related functions
- The introduction of an intent system that allows for user actions to be
  undone and replayed arbitrarily
- A complete UI facelift using Material UI icons and a new design language
- A new scripting system using WebAssembly + WASI and Rust as a guest language
  (look forward to an article on this soon!)
- The beginnings of a shared asset database that lets you and your team easily
  share assets amongst each other and with other projects
- Various infrastructural and rendering fixes, including more accurate PBR

Want to try Dims out for yourself? Come join the [Discord][dims-discord] to be

### [godot-rust][gd-github]

![godot-rust logo](godot-rust.png)

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.

The last few months have been a bit quieter around godot-rust. A lot of this
can be attributed to developers exploring the [GDExtension API][gd-gdext], the
successor of GDNative for Godot 4. At this point, a lot of the foundation is
still being built, however some more concrete plans are outlined in
[#824][gd-824]. Further updates will be posted in that issue or on Twitter.

Nevertheless, several improvements have been integrated to godot-rust since
0.10, with [version 0.10.1 on the horizon][gd-907]. Some notable examples:

- GDScript utility functions like `lerp`, `ease` or `linear2db` ([#901][gd-901])
- Property support for standard collection types ([#883][gd-883])
- Methods for `Rect2` and `Aabb` ([#867][gd-867])

### [Gamercade]

![Gamercade preview](gamercade.gif)
_WASM 3d CPU Rendering On a 2d Fantasy Console?_

[Gamercade] ([Discord][Gamercade-Discord], [Github][Gamercade-Github])
by @RobDavenport is a WASM powered fantasy console focused
on building multiplayer neo-retro games.

After over half a year in development, Gamercade and related tools are ready
for pre-alpha testing. This includes the [console](Gamercade-Console) itself,
as well as the [editor](Gamercade-Editor).

Gamercade's killer feature is ease of developing multiplayer games.
The console is able to simplify networked game development process
in the best way possible: build a local multiplayer game, and get full online
play for free!

The WASM Api features powerful but simple built-in features like input,
2d graphics, random number generation, and more. Limitations do exist, but are
flexible, such as resolutions up to 1920 x 1080, and a maximum of 256 color
palettes with up to 64 colors each.

The community around the project is small, but is looking to expand.
Come on over to the [subreddit](Gamercade-Subreddit), or hang out and chat
on [Discord](Gamercade-Discord), where the developers interact with members
and post updates daily. The project is newly [open source](Gamercade-Github)
and looking for contributors, suggestions, as well as awesome game demos.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Sand Fall With Compute Shaders in Rust]

![sandfall_8k](./draw_sand.gif)
_Drawing Sand_

[@hakolao](https://github.com/hakolao) published a
[tutorial](https://www.okkohakola.com/posts/sandfall_tutorial/) about creating
[cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
sand fall simulations with compute shaders.

Typically, cellular automata sand fall is done with the CPU due to the two way
relationship between the cells on a grid. This article shows a way to tackle
sand fall creation using compute shaders to achieve massive parallelism.

Additional to compute shaders, this tutorial is a great introduction to the
[Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano) library. It also works as a
good base for learning how to create simple graphics pipelines. You will also
get to use Bevy and Egui.

## Tooling Updates

### [NES Bundler][nes-bundler]

![NES Bundler running Data Man with GUI showing](nes-bundler.png)
_NES Bundler in action_

[NES Bundler][nes-bundler] by [@tedsteen].
Did you make a NES-game but none of your friends own a Nintendo? Don't worry.
Put your ROM and configuration in NES Bundler and build an executable for Mac,
Windows or Linux. What you get is a single executable with

- Simple UI for settings
- Re-mappable Keyboard and Gamepad input (you bundle your default mappings).
- Save/Restore state
- Netplay!

It's early days, but the key features are there and work is ongoing
to make it more mature!

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been into evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. It's current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add *many* new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!

## Library Updates

### [hecs]

[hecs] is a fast, lightweight, and unopinionated archetypal ECS library.

[Version 0.8][hecs-changelog] marks a breaking change to most methods that
previously took a generic type parameter `T: Component`, replacing them with
methods taking type parameters which must be *references to* component types
instead. This resolves a long-standing footgun where users accustomed to writing
`&T` in queries might write `world.get::<&T>`, interpreted by rustc as
referencing the valid component type `&'static T`, resulting in code that
compiles but fails to access the intended component.

[hecs]: https://github.com/Ralith/hecs
[hecs-changelog]: https://github.com/Ralith/hecs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#080

### [bevy_mod_wanderlust]

[bevy_mod_wanderlust]
([GitHub](https://github.com/PROMETHIA-27/bevy_mod_wanderlust)) by
[@PROMETHIA-27] is a character controller plugin for Bevy engine.

Inspired by [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdskE8PJy6Q),
it is implemented on top of [Rapier physics](https://rapier.rs/) and highly
customizable. Wanderlust includes a variety of settings to target many different
character controller types, including 2D/3D platformers, spacecraft, and
first/third person games.

### [Lyon]

![Variable width stroke in action](lyon.png)

[Lyon] ([GitHub](https://github.com/nical/lyon)) by [Nical](https://github.com/nical)
is a collection of crates providing various 2D vector graphics utilities, including
fast tessellation algorithms, easy to integrate in typical GPU accelerated rendering
engines.

Lyon made its symbolic [`1.0.0` release](https://crates.io/crates/lyon/1.0.0)
reflecting the stability of the project. Highlights in this release include:

- Initial support for variable line width in the stroke tessellator.
- An efficient algorithm to query positions at given distances along a path.
- Improved support for specifying custom endpoint attributes in paths and algorithms.
- And more. You can read the [announcement blog post here](https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-1-0.html).

### [Renet]

![GIF of demo using renet and bevy](renet_bevy_demo.gif)
*Demo using renet and bevy*

[Renet] by [@lucaspoffo] is a network library to create
games with the Server-Client architecture.

Built on top of UDP, it has its own protocol to send and receive reliable messages
more suited for fast-paced games than TCP. Some other features are:

- Connection management
- Authentication and encrypted connections
- Communication through multiple types of channels:
  - Reliable Ordered: guarantee ordering and delivery of all messages
  - Unreliable Unordered: no guarantee of delivery or ordering of messages
  - Block Reliable: for bigger messages, such as level initialization
- Packet fragmentation and reassembly

Renet comes with [bevy_renet], a plugin for the Bevy engine, and also with
[renet_visualizer], an egui interface to visualize network metrics.

### [miniquad]

![miniquad fileopen](miniquad_gl2.gif)
*VirtualBox, gl2 as the only GPU accelaration available*

[miniquad] is a safe and cross-platform rendering library
focused on portability and low-end platform support.

This month [OpenGl 2.1/GLESv2][gl2pr] PR got merged, adding support for old
android phones, virtual machines, and just old computers.

While the PR itself is quite small, it solved a very old design issue:
[compatibilities proposal][mqcompat]. Fixing this issue opened the door for
both lower-end backends, like gl1, and higher-level backends. Metal being the
next in line.

### [bevy_fbx]

![A model using a PBR shader featuring roughness and metalicness texture maps](bevy_fbx_maya_pbr.jpg)
_model courtesy of [Samuel Rosario], rendered in bevy_

[bevy_fbx] is a pre-alpha library to load FBX (Autodesk Filmbox) files
into [bevy] 0.8, based on [fbxcel-dom].
It currently:

- Loads geometry and meshes
- Loads mesh attributes such as color
- Loads default material diffuse textures, normal maps and emissive maps
- Loads the custom Maya PBR materials, including all material textures
- Load the scene tree and translate it to bevy's hierarchy

Planned features include providing a basic Lambert/Phong shader
to better handle more standard materials,
loading animations and skinned mesh skeletons/rigs.

The project is poorly tested and is looking for testers. It will soon be
available on crates.io.
