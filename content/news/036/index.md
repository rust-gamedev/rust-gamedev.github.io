Welcome to the 36th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Tokyo Rust Game Hack Event][tokyo-event]: Aug 12th

![pixelart ferris and bombs](bombercrab.jpeg)

The team at [tonari.no](http://tonari.no) is back with the second edition
of the Tokyo Rust Game Hack event!

> For this edition of the Game Hack event, we're dragging you back
> through the mists of time, to the earlier days of arcade games.
> We've built a Bevy-powered, simple reimagining of classic Bomberman,
> with a modern twist.
> Players don't participate by taking turns on an arcade stick.
> Instead, we will provide a crate that defines the character's
> interaction with the world through a Player trait.
> By simply implementing that trait and compiling to a wasm target,
> you'll be able to upload your character to the game, live.
> Adapt your strategy on the fly and bomb your way into the scoreboard!

[The player template repository][bombercrab-player] is open sourced
ahead of time so you can get a nice headstart.

If you decide to come please sign up on [the event's page][tokyo-event].
You can participate physically or online, see the full announcement
for the details.

### [Botnet]

![A grid with dots and arrows](botnet.png)

[Botnet] is an upcoming programming-based multiplayer game, where you write
scripts (compiled to WebAssembly) to control robots. Coordinate your network
of bots to gather resources, build new industry, and expand your control of
the server!

This month was primarily spent on BotnetReplayViewer - a visual program to
watch matches and inspect entity data.

Additionally, the antenna structure was added. Building an antenna gives you
control over the bay (room) it's in, letting you build additional structures,
and increasing the total number of bots you can control. Bots can also use
antennas to store resources.

Interested in contributing? Head over to the
[GitHub discussion page][botnet_ideas] and suggest some ideas!

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Gliding above a forest](veloren.jpg)
_New cave systems to explore_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In July, Veloren released 0.13! You can [read the full blog post][veloren-0.13]
that includes a trailer for the release party, and information about the new
features in the release. This release party set a new record for most players on
the server at once, going from 195 to now 277! This version brings modular
weapons, real-time weather, cliff towns, cave biomes, level of detail trees, and
much more.

Other than the release party, July saw lots of work getting done. The
translation system is undergoing an overhaul. Work is being done on the
Scrolling Combat Text system, which gives some visual indicator to how much
damage or healing you're taking. Though is going into how to better handle
server-side physics to reduce latency.

> The game is intended to run in the browser and will be written
> in Rust which will be compiled to WASM.
> I'm using a very new and not yet matured game engine called Bevy.
> I will be creating the art and models in the game using Blender.
>
> This will be a coding game which means players will have to use languages
> such as Python, Javascript, Rust, C++, and hopefully many more.
> It will be possible to play even if you don't know how to code but the game
> will try to guide you to use real code instead of predefined behavior sets.
> Follow my journey where I try to create an impossible solo indie game
> with little to no game dev experience.

### [Dims][dims-website]

![Concept art of a player creating a world in Dims](dims-concept-art.jpg)

[Dims][dims-website] ([Twitter][dims-twitter], [Discord][dims-discord],
[YouTube][dims-youtube]) is a pre-alpha collaborative open-world
creation platform.
Users can hop in sessions and build a game together, allowing everyone
to bring out their inner game-maker.

In July, development continued to make great strides. Some of the highlights
include:

- Continued work on the audio system, including in-game graphs of attenuation
  and other audio-related functions
- The introduction of an intent system that allows for user actions to be
  undone and replayed arbitrarily
- A complete UI facelift using Material UI icons and a new design language
- A new scripting system using WebAssembly + WASI and Rust as a guest language
  (look forward to an article on this soon!)
- The beginnings of a shared asset database that lets you and your team easily
  share assets amongst each other and with other projects
- Various infrastructural and rendering fixes, including more accurate PBR

Want to try Dims out for yourself? Come join the [Discord][dims-discord] to be
notified of future public tests, see the latest features before everyone else,

### [godot-rust][gd-github]

![godot-rust logo](godot-rust.png)

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.

The last few months have been a bit quieter around godot-rust. A lot of this
can be attributed to developers exploring the [GDExtension API][gd-gdext], the
successor of GDNative for Godot 4. At this point, a lot of the foundation is
still being built, however, some more concrete plans are outlined in
[#824][gd-824]. Further updates will be posted in that issue or on Twitter.

Nevertheless, several improvements have been integrated to godot-rust since
0.10, with [version 0.10.1 on the horizon][gd-907]. Some notable examples:

- GDScript utility functions like lerp, ease or linear2db ([#901][gd-901])
- Property support for standard collection types ([#883][gd-883])
- Methods for Rect2 and Aabb ([#867][gd-867])

### [Gamercade]

![Gamercade preview](gamercade.gif)
_WASM 3d CPU Rendering On a 2d Fantasy Console?_

[Gamercade] ([Discord][Gamercade-Discord], [GitHub][Gamercade-GitHub])
by @RobDavenport is a WASM-powered fantasy console focused
on building multiplayer neo-retro games.

After over half a year in development, Gamercade and related tools are ready
for pre-alpha testing. This includes the [console][Gamercade-Console] itself,
as well as the [editor][Gamercade-Editor].

Gamercade's killer feature is the ease of developing multiplayer games.
The console is able to simplify networked game development process
in the best way possible: build a local multiplayer game, and get full online
play for free!

The WASM Api features powerful but simple built-in features like input,
2d graphics, random number generation, and more. Limitations do exist, but are
flexible, such as resolutions up to 1920 x 1080, and a maximum of 256 color
palettes with up to 64 colors each.

The community around the project is small, but is looking to expand.
Come on over to the [subreddit][Gamercade-Subreddit], or hang out and chat
on [Discord][Gamercade-Discord], where the developers interact with members
and post updates daily. The project is newly [open source][Gamercade-GitHub]
and looking for contributors, suggestions, as well as awesome game demos.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Sand Fall With Compute Shaders in Rust][sandfall-tutorial]

![sandfall_8k](draw_sand.gif)
_Drawing Sand_

[@hakolao] published a [tutorial][sandfall-tutorial] about creating
[cellular automata][wiki-cgol] sand fall simulations with compute shaders.

Typically, cellular automata sand fall is done with the CPU due to the two-way
relationship between the cells on a grid. This article shows a way to tackle
sand fall creation using compute shaders to achieve massive parallelism.

Additional to compute shaders, this tutorial is a great introduction to the
[Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano) library. It also works as a
good base for learning how to create simple graphics pipelines. You will also
get to use Bevy and Egui.

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been on evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. Its current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add many new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!

### [bevy_shadertoy_wgsl] and [GLSL2WGSL]

![Shaders courtesy of @leondenise.](shadertoy_wgsl_leon.gif)

[bevy_shadertoy_wgsl] is a [Shadertoy] clone for the Bevy game engine,
where the GLSL shader language is replaced by WGSL. It already comes
with a dozen examples and plenty more to go. Feel free to add your own
shaders to the list!

Plus, [GLSL2WGSL] is a new translator tool that should help migrate the
vast majority of GLSL code to WGSL.

The above GIF showcases the new additions to the examples for
[bevy_shadertoy_wgsl]: two shaders originally written in [Shadertoy] by
[@leondenise], and translated to WGSL with the help of [GLSL2WGSL].
The first part is a reproduction of Joe Gardner from the movie Soul,
and the second part is a lightweight fluid shader.

### [Graphite][graphite-website]

![Graphite logo](graphite.png)

Graphite ([website][graphite-website], [GitHub][graphite-repo],
[Discord][graphite-discord], [Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is a free,
in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor that will be based around a
Rust-powered node graph compositing engine.

July's [sprint][graphite-sprint-17] focused on editor-centric
refactors upgrading stopgap measures to more robust systems.

- Making a splash: The default document is replaced by a welcome splash screen
  following a refactor allowing for zero open documents.
- Modifying for Macs: Input handling supports the nonstandard modifier keys on
  Mac keyboards, including labels in the UI.
- Setting a high bar: The menu bar cleans up actions and supports new ones like
  "File" > "Import". Displayed hotkeys are based on the actual key mapping
  source, varying by OS.
- Keeping organized: The editor codebase is restructured to cut away technical
  debt and create consistency for new contributors and better docs going forward.

## Library Updates

### [bevy_godot]

[bevy_godot] is an in-development library that offers a familiar Bevy environment
inside of the [Godot Engine][godot-engine]. [bevy_godot] currently features Scene
Tree integration, collision detection, spawning Godot scenes from Bevy, and
included examples to demonstrate the API. The upcoming update will feature Godot
signal events, Bevy assets integration, and a full implementation of the Dodge
the Creeps example game.

### [hecs]

[hecs] is a fast, lightweight, and unopinionated archetypal ECS library.

[Version 0.8][hecs-changelog] marks a breaking change to most methods that
previously took a generic type parameter `T: Component`, replacing them with
methods taking type parameters which must be _references to_ component types
instead. This resolves a long-standing footgun where users accustomed to writing
`&T` in queries might write `world.get::<&T>`, interpreted by rustc as
referencing the valid component type `&'static T`, resulting in code that
compiles but fails to access the intended component.

_Demo using renet and bevy_

[Renet] by [@lucaspoffo] is a network library to create
games with the Server-Client architecture.

Built on top of UDP, it has its own protocol to send and receive reliable messages
more suited for fast-paced games than TCP. Some other features are:

- Connection management
- Authentication and encrypted connections
- Communication through multiple types of channels:
  - Reliable Ordered: guarantee ordering and delivery of all messages
  - Unreliable Unordered: no guarantee of delivery or ordering of messages
  - Block Reliable: for bigger messages, such as level initialization
- Packet fragmentation and reassembly

Renet comes with [bevy_renet], a plugin for the Bevy engine, and also with
[renet_visualizer], an egui interface to visualize network metrics.

### [miniquad]

![miniquad fileopen](miniquad_gl2.gif)
_VirtualBox, gl2 as the only GPU acceleration available_

[miniquad] is a safe and cross-platform rendering library
focused on portability and low-end platform support.

This month [OpenGl 2.1/GLESv2][gl2pr] PR got merged, adding support for old
android phones, virtual machines, and just old computers.
While the PR itself is quite small, it solved a very old design issue:
[compatibilities proposal][mqcompat]. Fixing this issue opened the door for
both lower-end backends, like gl1, and higher-level backends. Metal is the
next in line.

### [bevy_mod_fbx]

![A model using a PBR shader featuring roughness and metalicness texture maps](bevy_fbx_maya_pbr.jpg)
_model courtesy of [Samuel Rosario], rendered in bevy_

[bevy_mod_fbx] is a pre-alpha library to load FBX (Autodesk Filmbox) files
into [bevy] 0.8, based on [fbxcel-dom].
It currently:

- Loads geometry and meshes
- Loads mesh attributes such as color
- Loads default material diffuse textures, normal maps, and emissive maps
- Loads the custom Maya PBR materials, including all material textures
- Load the scene tree and translate it to bevy's hierarchy

Planned features include providing a basic Lambert/Phong shader
to better handle more standard materials,
loading animations and skinned mesh skeletons/rigs.

The project is poorly tested and is looking for testers. It will soon be
available on crates.io.

_A visualization of a simple NPC behavior tree_

[bonsai-bt] by [@Sollimann] is a Rust implementation of behavior trees.

> A Behavior Tree (BT) is a data structure in which we can set the rules of how
> certain behaviors can occur and the order in which they would execute.
> BTs are a very efficient way of creating complex systems that
> are both modular and reactive.
> These properties are crucial in many applications,
> which has led to the spread of BT from computer game programming
> to many branches of AI and Robotics.

### [shades] and [shades-edsl]

![a source code that uses shades and a running app with the result:
a gradient from green to red](shades-edsl.png)

[@phaazon] has published [a detailed article][shades-article] that introduces
[shades] and [shades-edsl] - two Rust crates to write shaders by writing pure Rust:

- The [shades] crate provides all needed types and other building blocks
- while [shades-edsl] provides a proc-macro [EDSL][edsl-wiki]
for transforming regular Rust code into the API from shades.

> This crate provides an EDSL to build shaders, leveraging the Rust compiler (rustc)
> and its type system to ensure soundness and typing.
> Because shaders are written in Rust, this crate is completely language agnostic:
> it can in theory target any shading language - the current tier-1 language
> being GLSL. The EDSL allows to statically type shaders while still generating
> the actual shading code at runtime.

### [fdg]

![black dots connected with ed lines in #d space](fdg.png)

[fdg] by [@grantshandy] is a [force-directed graph][fdg-wiki] drawing framework.

> The goal of this project is to provide a force-directed graph framework
> and algorithms for Rust, as well as 2D and 3D visualizers
> that work on the web and desktop.
> It sits on top of [petgraph] and manages the positions of your nodes.

You can view all the examples online [here][fdg-web].

The project consists of three parts:

- [fdg-sim] - the underlying force simulation framework that handles your
  dataset's positions based on a physics engine of your choice (or creation).
- [fdg-macroquad] - a visualizer that uses macroquad for rendering.
- [fdg-img] - a SVG visualizer for your graphs.
