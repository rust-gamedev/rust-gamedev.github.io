Welcome to the 36th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [NES Bundler]

_NES Bundler in action_

[NES Bundler] (https://github.com/tedsteen/nes-bundler) by [@tedsteen].  
Did you make a NES-game but none of your friends own a Nintendo? Don't worry.  
Put your ROM and configuration in NES Bundler and build an executable for Mac, Windows or Linux.  
What you get is a single executable with
- Simple UI for settings
- Re-mappable Keyboard and Gamepad input (you bundle your default mappings).
- Save/Restore state
- Netplay!

It's early days, but the key features are there and work is ongoing to make it more mature!

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been into evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. It's current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add *many* new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!
