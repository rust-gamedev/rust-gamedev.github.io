Welcome to the 30th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Rusty Vangers]

_Rusty Vangers engine in action within the original game_

[Rusty Vangers] by [@kvark] is a modern re-implementation of the original
[Vangers] game from the last century.
It's in Rust, and uses GPU and multiple threads heavily.

Something incredible has been brewing within the small by dedicated community
of the original game. They prototyped a pluggable rendering interface in order
to support rendering the game via [Rusty Vangers] instead of the default
CPU-based rasterizer. The plugin is made as a static library sub-crate with a
bunch of C-exported functions.
Basic concept worked on the terrain, and the mini working group transitioned
to moving more visual features off the old path and into the Rust-based plugin.

At the same time, [Rusty Vangers] engine got a number of important
fixes and additions:

- water is rendered fair as transparent surfaces
- lighting evaluation on the second layer is fixed
- dynamic terrain and palette modification is supported
- custom viewport support
- can render menu screens, not just the game levels
