Welcome to the 50th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### You are Merlin

![You are Merlin screenshot](you-are-merlin.png)

You are Merlin ([Web Game][you-are-merlin-web], [GitHub - Rust/CLI][you-are-merlin-github], [GitHub - WASM][you-are-merlin-www-github]) by @hseager
is a text adventure game that compiles to both CLI and WebAssembly.

This initial version features a main quest, side quests, items and a boss fight.
Players can choose their favourite theme such as Zelda, Warcraft and Fallout. 
With the web version, players can select their prefered input method of buttons or keyboard and fully works on mobile.
Although fairly simple, this first version provides a good foundation for building more features in later updates.

_Jumpy: Machine gun and Periscope_

[Jumpy] ([GitHub][Jumpy], [Discord][jumpy_discord], [Twitter][jumpy_twitter]) by
[Spicy Lobster][spicy_lobster] is a pixel-style, tactical 2D shooter with a fishy
theme.

## Engine Updates

### Bottomless-Pit 0.3.1
![The Bottomles-Pit Logo. A small hole in the ground with cat ears and text saying bottomless-pit](https://eggshark.dev/images/bplogo.png)


Bottomless-Pit is a 2d game engine written with WGPU that has been around for a year which can be found on [crates.io][Bottomless-Pit_cratesio] and [GitHub][Bottomless-Pit_github].
Very recently a 2d camera was added as well as WASM and web support.
Current development is being focused on stability and QoL changes like texture sampling options and improved input.
You can checkout several engine examples on the web [here][Bottomless-Pit_Website].
Since the engine is in it's infancy it would be great to have developers use it and give the engine some feedback.
Current features are:

- Custom Shader Support
- basic rendering
- text rendering
- input and window event handling

## Learning Material Updates

### Building games for Android with Rust

@maciekglowka has recently shared some thoughts about building Rust games
for Android. Rather than a step-by-step guide, it is a collection
of issues one can possibly encounter when targeting Android.

Topics mentioned:

- 'window' creation (via winit)
- Android app's lifecycle vs. the WGPU surface creation
- user data storage
- system UI hiding via jni and Android API
- building AAB files to meet Google Play requirements

## Tooling Updates

## Library Updates

### [Lightyear 0.13][lightyear_website]

[lightyear_website] is a comprehensive networking library for bevy to make multiplayer games.
It comes with multiple types of transports (WebTransport, WebSocket, UDP, etc.) 
and supports replication techniques like client-side prediction, server interpolation, interest management and more!
Check out the [examples][lightyear_examples]!

The latest release, [0.13][lightyear_release], brings two big new features:
- **Steam support**: you can now use the Steamworks SDK as your transport layer, which lets you use the Valve network!
Note that lightyear supports running multiple transports in parallel, so it's possible to have cross-play between steam and non-steam users.
- **Listen-server mode**: it is now possible to run a server and a client in the same process/bevy app.
This can be useful to avoid the costs of a dedicated server, or to have a similar codebase between singleplayer and multiplayer.

[Example (with 300ms of latency)](https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear/assets/8112632/ee547c32-1f14-4bdc-9e6d-67f900af84d0)
