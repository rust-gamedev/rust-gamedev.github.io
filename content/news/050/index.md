Welcome to the 50th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Monk Tower

![Monk Tower Screen shot](monk_tower.png)

Monk Tower ([itch.io][monk-tower-itch], [Google Play][monk-tower-play], [Github][monk-tower-github])
is a tiny coffee-break roguelike game, intended for short runs (ca. 15mins).

The gameplay is quite distilled and revolves mostly around resource management.
The player has limited inventory capacity and the weapons get damaged
after each use. There are 20 randomly generated levels to beat.

It is available on desktop (Windows / Linux), Android an Web (mobile friendly).
The game is open-sourced - together with a custom WGPU-based 2d framework.

## Engine Updates

### Bottomless-Pit 0.3.1
![The Bottomles-Pit Logo. A small hole in the ground with cat ears and text saying bottomless-pit](https://eggshark.dev/images/bplogo.png)


Bottomless-Pit is a 2d game engine written with WGPU that has been around for a year which can be found on [crates.io][Bottomless-Pit_cratesio] and [GitHub][Bottomless-Pit_github].
Very recently a 2d camera was added as well as WASM and web support.
Current development is being focused on stability and QoL changes like texture sampling options and improved input.
You can checkout several engine examples on the web [here][Bottomless-Pit_Website].
Since the engine is in it's infancy it would be great to have developers use it and give the engine some feedback.
Current features are:

- Custom Shader Support
- basic rendering
- text rendering
- input and window event handling

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

## Library Updates

### [Lightyear 0.13][lightyear_website]

[lightyear_website] is a comprehensive networking library for bevy to make multiplayer games.
It comes with multiple types of transports (WebTransport, WebSocket, UDP, etc.) 
and supports replication techniques like client-side prediction, server interpolation, interest management and more!
Check out the [examples][lightyear_examples]!

The latest release, [0.13][lightyear_release], brings two big new features:
- **Steam support**: you can now use the Steamworks SDK as your transport layer, which lets you use the Valve network!
Note that lightyear supports running multiple transports in parallel, so it's possible to have cross-play between steam and non-steam users.
- **Listen-server mode**: it is now possible to run a server and a client in the same process/bevy app.
This can be useful to avoid the costs of a dedicated server, or to have a similar codebase between singleplayer and multiplayer.

[Example (with 300ms of latency)](https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear/assets/8112632/ee547c32-1f14-4bdc-9e6d-67f900af84d0)
