### [@rust_gamedev Mastodon Feed][masto]

![a screenshot of the account's header: gamepad-in-gear logo,
description and verified links](mastodon.png)

As you may know, we have [a @rust_gamedev Twitter account][twi] for
making announcements and collecting all the cool rust gamedev stuff there
into one feed.

In the last couple of months a significant portion of rust game developers
has either migrated from Twitter to [Mastodon] or started cross-posting there,
so [we've decided][masto-issue] to create a similar "official"
[@rust_gamedev account on the mastodon.gamedev.place server][masto].

Please follow us there and post your own relevant updates on [Fediverse]
using either the #RustGameDev tag or #RustLang #GameDev combo.

### [Temple Knight]

![Shooting automatons in Temple Knight](temple-knight.jpg)
_Shooting automatons in Temple Knight_

Temple Knight ([Itch.io][tk-itch], [Twitter][tk-twitter])
by [@nilaysavant] is a 3D FPS game developed using [Bevy].
You play the role of a knight and protect the temple from raiding automatons.

What began as an experiment to learn game dev in Rust using [Bevy].
Initially motivated by the visual appeal of a [scene running in the browser via WASM].
It quickly started taking the shape of a game:

- From adding [Rapier] for [basic physics] to developing mechanics for other entities.
- Path finding for Automaton's using [control systems].
- Which was later switched to a deterministic [A-start navmesh approach].
- Developed mechanics for the player controller including the first-person-camera.
- Implemented weapon + projectiles systems.
- Finally, [custom shaders for projectiles] were added as a finishing touch.

An experiment that became the first game published by [@nilaysavant].
Play [Temple Knight] in your browser.

### [Cargo Space][cargospace]

![cargo space screenshot: two instances of the game running in parallel](cargo_space.png)

[Cargo Space][cargospace] ([Discord][cargospace_discord]) by
[@johanhelsing][johanhelsing_mastodon] is a co-op 2d space game where you build a
ship and fly it through space looking for new parts, fighting pirates and the
environment.

Johan wrote [an introductory post][cargospace_devlog_0] about the design idea,
and a tentative plan for its development.

The first step was to make an initial offline single-player prototype. This is
covered in the [first devlog][cargospace_devlog_1] along with topics such as
procedural generation, 2d platforming, bloom, and various community Bevy crates,
such as [bevy_ecs_tilemap], [bevy_ecs_ldtk] and [bevy_particle_systems].

The procedural generation needs for the game also resulted in a new crate being born.
[noisy_bevy] is a CPU and GPU noise plugin for Bevy.

After this, p2p rollback networking was added using [bevy_ggrs] and [Matchbox].
The [second devlog][cargospace_devlog_2] goes through this in detail, and in
particular how integration between [bevy_ggrs] and [leafwing_input_manager] was
implemented.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![A wendigo at night](veloren.jpg)
_A fearsome wendigo encounter_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In December, work has been done to create a website to better assist moderation
in the game. Several months of project finances were done, and all of the data
is [publically visible][veloren-finances]. Work on Wyverns has continued, and
lots of effort is being put into their wings. Some UI elements have changed
location, both the bag and spellbook buttons were merged with other button bars.

Frost Gigas are another big item in the works. These creatures will be Veloren's
world boss. Gigas will hopefully be the first of a numerous elemental giants to
roam the open world of Veloren and will need a large group of players to be able
to take it down and collect it's new uncraftable and legendary loot!

### [Thetawave]

![repeater boss](repeater_boss.gif)
_First boss enemy in Thetawave_

Thetawave is an open-source, roguelite, physics-based, space shooter game made
with [Bevy] and [Rapier].

This month, the first boss enemy was added to the
game. Unlike other enemies, it is composed of a single "mob" entity and 7
"mob segment" entities. It also uses behavior sequences to regularly change
its active set of behaviors. You can follow [@carlosupina] on Twitter for
regular updates about the game.

### [Jumpy]

![Swords, Crates, Grenades, & Mines](jumpy.png)
_Jumpy Items: Swords, Crates, Grenades, & Mines_

[Jumpy] ([GitHub][Jumpy], [Discord][jumpy_discord], [Twitter][jumpy_twitter]) by
[Spicy Lobster][spicy_lobster] is a pixel-style, tactical 2D shooter with a fishy
theme.

In the last month, work started on a new architecture for the core Jumpy game loop.

Determinism and snapshot/restore functionality has been a challenge for
networking support in jumpy. To address this, Jumpy has started migrating the core
game loop to a custom, micro Entity Component System that is deterministic and can
be trivially snapshot and restored.

By being simple and planning to eventually support a pure C API, it's also
intended for the micro-ECS approach to make it vastly easier to create a
performant modding interface to Jumpy in the future.

Work has almost been finished on the new Bones ECS and the surrounding [Bones]
framework, which is still built on Bevy for rendering and otherwise talking to
the hardware. The hope is that Bones can become a framework for making other
games similar in scope to Jumpy, without those games have to re-invent everything
that was needed to get features like UI, networking, localization, asset loading,
etc.

As soon as the ECS migration is finished, the plan is to get the final game juicing
and polish done and to make a proper MVP release.

### [Hydrofoil Generation]

![hgs_screen](hydrofoil_41.jpg)

[Hydrofoil Generation]
([Steam][hgs_steam], [Facebook][hgs_facebook], [Discord][hgs_discord])
is a realistic sailing/foiling inshore simulator in development for PC/Steam
that will put you in the driving seat of modern competitive sailing.

The game is written completely in Rust, using a custom engine based on
DirectX 11, physics powered by Rapier-3D.

Jaxx Vane Studio army of 2, Stefano Casillo and Chax Duero is pushing
through the final steps to get the game ready for Steam Early Access release.

As final QA approaches the team is at work to add the last level of polish
and more details as possible to every aspect of the game.

A new Tutorial System has been added to introduce people with different
backgrounds to the game as gently as possible making the learning curve
of this complex simulator less steep.

Stefano is also back on [Twitch][hgs_twitch] streaming coding sessions live.

Hydrofoil Generation should be available on Steam in the first months of 2023.

- Chain reaction: The Imaginate feature, an AI image generation workflow
  powered by [Stable Diffusion][graphite-stable-diffusion], becomes a node.
  Chain together a sequence of fine-tuned generation steps. And explore ideas
  by branching the graph into new creative directions.
- Node nurturing: New features provide polish to the node graph. Nodes can be
  copy/pasted, hidden, previewed, and linked more easily.
- Bugs, begone!: A major effort to improve editor usability fixes dozens of
  bugs and paper cuts. Boolean shape operations now crash less frequently, the
  UI no longer slows down badly over time, and undo history is finally fixed.

Stay tuned for the imminent Alpha Milestone 2 release and progress converting
existing features into nodes.

## Library Updates

### [Inox2d][inox2d]

![The Japanese character for "inochi" set into a sprocket](inox2d_logo.svg)

[Inox2d][inox2d] ([Discord][inox2d-discord]) by the Inox2d Workgroup
is an experimental official Rust implementation
of the [Inochi2D] puppet animation technology.
Inochi2d is notably used by the popular vtuber [@AsahiLina].

Currently, Inox2d is still not on par with the [reference implementation][Inochi2D-src].
Basic features like [animations][inox2d-animations] and
a proper [camera API][inox2d-camera] have yet to be worked on.

Users who really want to use it should instead go with the reference implementation.
If using Rust, through the official [inochi2d-rs] bindings.

Currently, Inox2d contributors are working on a [WGPU renderer backend][inox2d-wgpu].
They are also looking forward towards an [official Bevy integration][inox2d-bevy]!

### [bevy_rpg]

![an UI showing the currently running dialog in the bottom
and some control buttons in the top-right corner](bevy-rpg.png)

[bevy_rpg] ([Discord channel][bevy-rpg-discord]) by [@fianathedevgirl]
is a plugin allowing RPG or visual novel dialogs
to be made with the Bevy game engine.

At the moment, it can be used for very basic dialogs.
"Choose dialog" or text input dialog are still not implemented
and the dialog controller buttons doesn't work yet.

If you are interested in seeing how it should be used in production,
checkout ["Project Flara"][project-flara]. It's a prototype/demo game
made by the same author showcasing a JRPG-ish indie game written in Rust.
The author also made a basic example [here][bevy-rpg-example].

![egui_dnd in action](egui_dnd.gif)
_A [showcase](https://lucasmerlin.github.io/egui_dnd/) of egui_dnd_

[egui_dnd] ([github][egui_dnd_github], [crates.io][egui_dnd_crates_io]) by [@lucasmerlin]
is a new drag and drop sorting crate for egui. While egui itself includes some drag
and drop support, it's not intuitive to use. This crate provides a simple
abstraction over egui's drag and drop features.

The first release contains initial support for vertical sorting. If there
is interest, more features could be added.

### [Mun v0.4.0][mun-release]

[![Mun logo](mun-logo.svg)][Mun]

[Mun] is a scripting language for gamedev focused on quick iteration times
that is written in Rust.

The previous Mun release dates back over one and a half years. Since then -
slowly but steadily - the Mun Community and Core Team have been working towards
Mun v0.4.0 and it’s finally here!

Mun v0.4 does not only bring array support to Mun, but it also lays the
groundwork for a plethora of language features that require indirect types and
recursion. For a full list have a look at the [changelog][mun-changelog], but
the main improvements are:

- Dynamically-sized arrays
- Simplified function invocations from Rust
- Simplified struct API for Rust
- Apple M1 & experimental iOS support
- Upgrade to LLVM 13
- Support for runtime usage in entity component systems (ECS)

### [rust-gpu v0.4.0][rust-gpu-release]

![a screenshot: spherical characters doing stuff](rust-gpu.jpg)
_Embark's [Creative Playground][embark-creative-playground],
which uses rust-gpu and raytracing_

[Rust-gpu][rust-gpu] ([Discord][rust-gpu-discord]) allows you
to write your GPU shaders in the Rust language.
It consists of a Rust compiler backend for generating SPIR-V shader
modules and an API to address GPU resources.

Release v0.4.0 brings a lot of upgrades, bug fixes, maturity, and now also
supports raytracing shaders! Furthermore, all dependent crates have been
published to crates.io, so pointing to rust-gpu's GitHub in your Cargo.toml
is no longer required.

### [egui v0.20][egui-twi]

![Demo of improved tables shows smooth column resizing](egui.gif)

[egui] is an easy-to-use immediate mode GUI library in pure Rust.

This month [egui v0.20][egui-twi] was released. Highlights:

- Support for [AccessKit] vastly improves the accessibility of [eframe] apps
  on Windows and Mac.
- Vastly improved tables (see above) for [rerun.io]'s needs.
- Improved wgpu renderer that now allows using  egui-wgpu on the web,
  with a WebGL backend.
- egui now expects integrations to do all color blending in gamma space.
- Interactive widgets can now be on top of other interactive widgets.
  Great for putting floating widgets on top of 3D content, for instance.
- [ecolor] helper lib for all the color conversions needs.
- Helper functions for animating panels that collapse/expand.

For full details see the [changelog][egui-changelog].

### [google/forma][forma]

[![two screenshots of an asteroids-like game: left is normal,
right shows only tiles that changed from the last frame](google-forma.png)
][forma-demo]

[forma] by google is a (thoroughly) parallelized experimental
Rust vector-graphics renderer with both a software (CPU) and hardware (GPU)
back-end having the [goals][forma-goals] of portability, performance, simplicity,
and minimal size.
Forma relies on Rust's SIMD auto-vectorization/intrinsics and [Rayon]
to have good performance on the CPU,
while using [WebGPU] ([wgpu]) to take advantage of the GPU.

A few implementation highlights that make the library stand out
from commonly used vector renderers:

> - Curvature-aware flattening.
>   All higher cubic Béziers are approximated by quadratic ones, then,
>   in parallel, flattened to line segments according to their curvature.
>   This [technique] was developed by Raph Levien.
> - Cheap translations and rotations.
>   Translations and rotations can be rendered without having
>   to re-flatten the curves, all the while maintaining full quality.
> - Parallel pixel grid intersection.
>   Line segments are transformed into pixel segments by intersecting them
>   with the pixel grid. We developed a simple method that performs this computation
>   in O(1) and which is run in parallel.
> - Efficient sorting.
>   We ported [crumsort] to Rust and parallelized it with Rayon, delivering
>   improved performance over its pdqsort implementation for 64-bit random data.
>   Scattering pixel segments with a sort was inspired from Allan MacKinnon's work
>   on [Spinel].
> - Update only the tiles that change (currently CPU-only).
>   We implemented a fail-fast per-tile optimizer that tries to skip
>   the painting step entirely. A similar approach could also be tested on the GPU.

While Forma is a general-purpose library it can be an interesting building block
for vector-based games and engines (see the [spaceship demo][forma-demo]
from the above image).
