Welcome to the 41st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[`bevy-rpg`] ([GitHub](https://github.com/project-flara/bevy-rpg)) by [@fianathedevgirl](https://github.com/fianathedevgirl)
is a plugin allowing RPG or visual novel dialogs to be made with the Bevy game engine. 

At the moment, it can be used for very basic dialogs. 
"Choose dialog" or text input dialog are still not implemented.
The dialog controller buttons doesn't work yet.

If you are interested in seeing how it should be used in production, checkout ["Project Flara"](https://github.com/project-flara/project-flara).
It's a prototype/demo game made by the same author showcasing a JRPG-ish indie game written in Rust. 
The author also made a basic example [here](https://github.com/project-flara/bevy-rpg/blob/main/examples/basic.rs).
