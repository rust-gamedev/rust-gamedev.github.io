Welcome to the 41st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Inox2d][inox2d]

![The Japanese character for "inochi" set into a sprocket](inox2d_logo.svg)

[Inox2d][inox2d] ([Discord][inox2d-discord]) by the Inox2d Workgroup
is an experimental official Rust implementation
of the [Inochi2D] puppet animation technology.
Inochi2d is notably used by the popular vtuber [@AsahiLina].

Currently, Inox2d is still not on par with the [reference implementation][Inochi2D-src].
Basic features like [animations][inox2d-animations] and
a proper [camera API][inox2d-camera] have yet to be worked on.

Users who really want to use it should instead go with the reference implementation.
If using Rust, through the official [inochi2d-rs] bindings.

Currently, Inox2d contributors are working on a [WGPU renderer backend][inox2d-wgpu].
They are also looking forward towards an [official Bevy integration][inox2d-bevy]!

### [bevy_rpg]

![an UI showing the currently running dialog in the bottom
and some control buttons in the top-right corner](bevy-rpg.png)

[bevy_rpg] ([Discord channel][bevy-rpg-discord]) by [@fianathedevgirl]
is a plugin allowing RPG or visual novel dialogs
to be made with the Bevy game engine.

At the moment, it can be used for very basic dialogs.
"Choose dialog" or text input dialog are still not implemented
and the dialog controller buttons doesn't work yet.

If you are interested in seeing how it should be used in production,
checkout ["Project Flara"][project-flara]. It's a prototype/demo game
made by the same author showcasing a JRPG-ish indie game written in Rust.
The author also made a basic example [here][bevy-rpg-example].
