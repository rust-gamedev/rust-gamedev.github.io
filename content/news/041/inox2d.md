Inox2d ([GitHub](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inox2d/), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/abnxwN6r9v)) by the Inox2d Workgroup
is an experimental official Rust implementation of the [Inochi2D](https://inochi2d.com/) puppet animation technology.
Inochi2d is notably used by the popular vtuber [Asahi Lina](https://www.youtube.com/@AsahiLina).

Currently, Inox2d is still not on par with the [reference implementation](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d).
Basic features like [animations](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inox2d/issues/5) and a proper [camera API](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inox2d/issues/7) have yet to be worked on.

Users who really want to use it should instead go with the reference implementation.
If using Rust, trough the official [inochi2d-rs](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d-rs) bindings.

Currently, Inox2d contributors are working on a [WGPU renderer backend](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inox2d/pull/6).
They are also looking forward towards an [official Bevy integration](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inox2d/issues/1)!
