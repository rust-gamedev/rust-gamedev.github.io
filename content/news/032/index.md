## Game Updates

### [Bevy Jam][bevy-jam-results]

![Bevy Jam](bevy-jam.png)

Voting on the first-ever [Bevy Jam][bevy-jam] just finished! It was a
week-long event, where the goal was to make a game in
[Bevy Engine][bevy-engine], the free and open-source game engine
built in Rust. The theme was 'Unfair Advantage'.

The [full results can be found on itch.io][bevy-jam-results]. Here
are the top five games:

[bevy-jam]: https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-1/

[bevy-engine]: https://bevyengine.org/

#### ðŸ¥‡ First Place: [Petty Party][petty-party]

![Petty Party logo](pettyparty.png)

[Petty Party][petty-party] is a Mario Party inspired board game,
in which you play against the world's worst opponent, who's
actively rigging the game against you.

The game was originally very hard to beat, so the devs balanced
the jam release fairly heavily in the player's favour - however,
if you beat the game, you can unlock the original difficulty
as a 'hard mode'!

The source for the game is available on [GitHub][petty-party-source].

[petty-party]: https://jabuwu.itch.io/petty-party
[petty-party-source]: https://github.com/jabuwu/petty-party

#### ðŸ¥ˆ Second Place: [Â¿QuiÃ©n es el MechaBurro?][mechaburro-itchio]

![Â¿QuiÃ©n es el MechaBurro?](mechaburro.gif)

[Â¿QuiÃ©n es el MechaBurro?][mechaburro-itchio] is a singleplayer/local
multiplayer game (up to 4 players) with bots (8 total burros)
inspired by twin-stick shooters and aspects of Mario Kart. Players
choose to play as one of the burro piÃ±atas and then attempt to be
the last burro standing in each level of the game. At the start
of each round, one burro is chosen randomly to be upgraded to the
Mechaburro, giving them an unfair advantage.

A postmortem devlog detailing the process of making the game during the
jam can be found [here][mechaburro-postmortem], a trailer for the game is
[viewable on YouTube][mechaburro-youtube] and the source code for the game
is available [on Github][mechaburro-github].

#### ðŸ¥‰ Third Place: [Chaz]

![Chaz screenshot](chaz.png)

[Chaz] is a platform racing game, where you have to stay close to your
opponent in order to see where you're going. Beat them to the floating
heart to win - but be warned, once you do, they'll steal your moves!

The source code is available on [GitHub][chaz-source].

[chaz]: https://luizchagasjardim.itch.io/chaz
[chaz-source]: https://github.com/lcjgames/chaz

#### Fourth Place: [Warlock's Gambit][warlocks-gambit-itchio]

![Warlock's Gambit Screenshot](warlocks_gambit.jpg)

[Warlock's Gambit][warlocks-gambit-itchio] is a puzzle game constructed like a
card game, playable in the browser. You are given a static deck and have to play
your cards carefully to beat your opponent. In keeping with the theme of the
jam, the decks are stacked against you, in fact, it's impossible to win by
default. But you have a trick up your sleeve, literally. You can drag a card in
your sleeve to play it later.

The jam release was limited and confusing, but a post-jam update fixed the
most annoying bugs, clarified the game rules, enabled importing custom decks,
and added great code documentation (including a flow diagram demonstrating the
game state changes).

The game code is licensed under MIT or Apache-2 and is [available on
Github][warlocks-gambit-github].

#### Fifth Place: [Cheaters Never Win][cheaters-never-win]

![Clip of Cheaters Never Win gameplay](cheatersneverwin.gif)

[Cheaters Never Win][cheaters-never-win] is an unfairly difficult
infinite runner set in a cyberpunk world.

Collect keycaps in order to unlock cheat codes, which will give
you access to forbidden powers - like jumping, and moving left!

The source for this game is available on [GitHub][cnw-source].

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Veloren on the Steam Deck](veloren-steamdeck.jpg)
_Veloren on the Steam Deck!_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In March, Veloren was tested on the SteamDeck, which you can read about in
detail in [the weekly devblog][veloren-steamdeck-section]. Lots of work was done
with Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, including some bug fixes, but mainly the
switch to Github Releases as the download backend. This will make game updates
significantly faster and more reliable for players. Work is also being done to
make use of Github's HTTP range requests to do partial patches where possible.
Audio work was done to improve swimming sounds playing unevenly, and more sounds
to gliding.

Veloren was also mentioned [on Hacker News][veloren-hn], and lots of great
discussions happened in the comment section. In 2021, Veloren spoke at Rust in
Arts, and [the recording has recently been posted][veloren-rust-in-arts]. The
0.13 release map is in the works, with a jungle theme. CliffTowns are being
developed, as a new town located in the mountains. Veloren recorded another
reading club episode, this time about [Tracy and
optimizations][veloren-reading-club-7]. A new series was also started, and the
first [Veloren Code Review was recorded][veloren-code-review-1].

Nonograms (AKA Picross) are logic puzzles that involve filling in cells on a
grid. The goal of [rust-nonogram] is to be a quick and engaging time-killer.
Featuring random puzzles and simple controls, it is a great way to have some
fun and test your skills.

by [@Sheepyhead](https://twitter.com/devsheepy)
is an event-based Bevy crate for handling the logic side of match 3 games so
you can worry about making everything else!

This was recently released in its first public version, so there are several
parts to improve, and it could really use some battle testing.

was no good starter documentation and a few bugs. There is a [getting started][s13-getting-started]
guide now! Also, a ton of new features that have been added in the last month:

- ImGui support
- Mac support
- Shader specialization
