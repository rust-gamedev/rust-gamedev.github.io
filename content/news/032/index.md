Welcome to the {TODO}th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

V-Racer ([GitHub][vracer-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a retro
drift racing game inspired by Atari
Battlezone and Wipeout created using
Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].
The game is part of an open source
[repository][s9-minigame-repo] of several
mini-games that use this framework.

[dos-like-rs] by [@E_net4]
provides Rust bindings to Mattias Gustavsson's `dos-like`,
a cross-platform framework for writing modern applications
with the look & feel of MS-DOS programs from the early 90's.

A few technical details about the conception of these bindings
are presented in a [blog post on Dev.to][dos-like-rs-dev].

### [godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust)

![godot-rust logo](godot-rust.png)

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.

We are pleased to announce the release of godot-rust version 0.10.0.
This update brings many new quality-of-life features, such as basic
async and serde support, more flexible exporting of Rust symbols to
Godot, better CI and doc integration, among many more features that
have previously been exclusive to the [GitHub repo][gd-github].

This release also makes the the API much more more user-friendly than
previous versions with more consistent naming, flatter module structure
and fewer redundancies.

Thank you to all of the contributors who made this possible!

A full list of a the changes are available in the [changelog][gd-changelog].
