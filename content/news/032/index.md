Welcome to the {TODO}th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

V-Racer ([GitHub][vracer-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a retro
drift racing game inspired by Atari
Battlezone and Wipeout created using
Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].
The game is part of an open source
[repository][s9-minigame-repo] of several
mini-games that use this framework.

### [bevy_match3]

![An animated gif depicting a simple match 3 game where gems are matched in sets of 3 or more and new gems drop down to take their place](bevy_match3_example.gif)

[bevy_match3] ([GitHub](https://github.com/Sheepyhead/bevy_match3)) by [@Sheepyhead](https://twitter.com/devsheepy)
is an event-based bevy crate for handling the logic side of match 3 games so you can worry about making everything else!

This was recently released in its first public version, and there are several parts to improve, and it could really use some battle testing.

### [dos-like-rs]

![Screenshot of example "rotozoom" from dos-like-rs,

[dos-like-rs] by [@E_net4]
provides Rust bindings to Mattias Gustavsson's `dos-like`,
a cross-platform framework for writing modern applications
with the look & feel of MS-DOS programs from the early 90's.

A few technical details about the conception of these bindings
are presented in a [blog post on Dev.to][dos-like-rs-dev].
