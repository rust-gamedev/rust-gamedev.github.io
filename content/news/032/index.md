## Game Updates

### [Bevy Jam][bevy-jam-results]

![Bevy Jam](bevy-jam.png)

Voting on the first-ever [Bevy Jam][bevy-jam] just finished! It was a
week-long event, where the goal was to make a game in
[Bevy Engine][bevy-engine], the free and open-source game engine
built in Rust. The theme was 'Unfair Advantage'.

The [full results can be found on itch.io][bevy-jam-results], and you can read
an [exploration of the entries][bevy-jam-exploration] to find out about how
these entries used different asset formats, crates, and Bevy features.

Here are the top five games:

#### ðŸ¥‡ First Place: [Petty Party][petty-party]

![Petty Party logo](pettyparty.png)

[Petty Party][petty-party] is a Mario Party inspired board game,
in which you play against the world's worst opponent, who's
actively rigging the game against you.

The game was originally very hard to beat, so the devs balanced
the jam release fairly heavily in the player's favour - however,
if you beat the game, you can unlock the original difficulty
as a 'hard mode'!

The source for the game is available on [GitHub][petty-party-source].

[petty-party]: https://jabuwu.itch.io/petty-party
[petty-party-source]: https://github.com/jabuwu/petty-party

#### ðŸ¥ˆ Second Place: [Â¿QuiÃ©n es el MechaBurro?][mechaburro-itchio]

![Â¿QuiÃ©n es el MechaBurro?](mechaburro.gif)

[Â¿QuiÃ©n es el MechaBurro?][mechaburro-itchio] is a singleplayer/local
multiplayer game (up to 4 players) with bots (8 total burros)
inspired by twin-stick shooters and aspects of Mario Kart. Players
choose to play as one of the burro piÃ±atas and then attempt to be
the last burro standing in each level of the game. At the start
of each round, one burro is chosen randomly to be upgraded to the
Mechaburro, giving them an unfair advantage.

A postmortem devlog detailing the process of making the game during the
jam can be found [here][mechaburro-postmortem], a trailer for the game is
[viewable on YouTube][mechaburro-youtube] and the source code for the game
is available [on GitHub][mechaburro-github].

#### ðŸ¥‰ Third Place: [Chaz]

![Chaz screenshot](chaz.png)

[Chaz] is a platform racing game, where you have to stay close to your
opponent in order to see where you're going. Beat them to the floating
heart to win - but be warned, once you do, they'll steal your moves!

The source code is available on [GitHub][chaz-source].

[chaz]: https://luizchagasjardim.itch.io/chaz

#### Fourth Place: [Warlock's Gambit][warlocks-gambit-itchio]

![Warlock's Gambit Screenshot](warlocks_gambit.jpg)

[Warlock's Gambit][warlocks-gambit-itchio] is a puzzle game constructed like a
card game, playable in the browser. You are given a static deck and have to play
your cards carefully to beat your opponent. In keeping with the theme of the
jam, the decks are stacked against you. In fact, it's impossible to win by
default. But you have a trick up your sleeve, literally. You can drag a card in
your sleeve to play it later.

The jam release was limited and confusing, but a post-jam update fixed the
most annoying bugs, clarified the game rules, enabled importing custom decks,
and added great code documentation (including a flow diagram demonstrating the
game state changes).

The game code is licensed under MIT or Apache-2 and is [available on
GitHub][warlocks-gambit-github].

[warlocks-gambit-itchio]: https://gibonus.itch.io/warlocks-gambit
[warlocks-gambit-github]: https://github.com/team-plover/warlocks-gambit

#### Fifth Place: [Cheaters Never Win][cheaters-never-win]

![Clip of Cheaters Never Win gameplay](cheatersneverwin.gif)

[Cheaters Never Win][cheaters-never-win] is an unfairly difficult
infinite runner set in a cyberpunk world.

Collect keycaps in order to unlock cheat codes, which will give
you access to forbidden powers - like jumping, and moving left!

Since the jam, the team has begun work on a full release for the game.

The source for this game is available on [GitHub][cnw-source].

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Veloren on the Steam Deck](veloren-steamdeck.jpg)
_Veloren on the Steam Deck!_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In March, Veloren was tested on the SteamDeck, which you can read about in
detail in [the weekly devblog][veloren-steamdeck-section]. Lots of work was done
with Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, including some bug fixes, but mainly the
switch to GitHub Releases as the download backend. This will make game updates
significantly faster and more reliable for players. Work is also being done to
make use of GitHub's HTTP range requests to do partial patches where possible.
Audio work was done to improve swimming sounds playing unevenly, and more sounds
to gliding.

Veloren was also mentioned [on Hacker News][veloren-hn], and lots of great
discussions happened in the comment section. In 2021, Veloren spoke at Rust in
Arts, and [the recording has recently been posted][veloren-rust-in-arts]. The
0.13 release map is in the works, with a jungle theme. CliffTowns are being
developed, as a new town located in the mountains. Veloren recorded another
reading club episode, this time about [Tracy and
optimizations][veloren-reading-club-7]. A new series was also started, and the
first [Veloren Code Review was recorded][veloren-code-review-1].

### [Notan v0.2.1][Notan]

![notan](notan.jpg)

[Notan] is a simple and portable layer designed to create your own multimedia
apps on top of it without worrying about platform-specific code.

The main goal is to provide a set of APIs and tools that can be used to create
your project in an ergonomic manner without enforcing any structure or pattern,
always trying to stay out of your way. The idea is that you can use it as a
foundation layer or backend for your next app, game engine, or game.

Version [v0.2.1] improves and adds features focusing on the creation of apps,
like select mouse cursor or lazy loop among other things. The main focus was
to improve the integration with [egui] supporting all its features.

[Notan]: https://github.com/Nazariglez/notan
[v0.2.1]: https://github.com/Nazariglez/notan/releases/tag/v0.2.0

### [Bevy Cheatbook]

The [Bevy Cheatbook] by Ida Iyes is an unofficial reference-style book
teaching the Bevy game engine. It got many improvements over the past month.

There is a new [guided tutorial page][bevy-cb-tutorial], to help you navigate
the book in an order that makes sense for learning, starting from beginner
topics and progressing towards more advanced! There is also a new "getting
started" page, as an alternative to Bevy's official instructions.

New topics added to the book: working with Bevy Time/Timers/Stopwatches, ECS
data storage kinds, exclusive systems, direct World access, non-Send types,
and moreâ€¦

Many pages have been overhauled for correctness and the quality of various
code examples improved.

### [Graphite][graphite-website]

![Graphite](graphite-node-graph.png)

Graphite is an in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor that is free
and open source. It will be powered by a node graph compositing engine that
supercharges your layer stack, providing a completely non-destructive editing
experience.

With the completion of the node graph UX design, work has begun building the
frontend and backend systems for the big leap to node-driven vector editing.
This works by composing groups of Rust functions together at runtime and/or
compile time. [Watch the (brief) talk][graphite-gamedev-nodes-talk] about how
the backend implementation works around challenges imposed by Rust.

New editor features this month include importing bitmap image layers and
customizing stroke styling with dashed lines and rounded or beveled corners.
The [project website][graphite-website] is also now mostly content-complete,
including new node graph mockups.

Check out the [new website][graphite-website], try the
[Graphite editor][graphite-live-demo] right now in your browser, star on

library provides a thin Vulkan 1.1 driver using smart pointers and a fully-generic
render graph structure.

Earlier this year [Screen 13] was updated with a dynamic graph pattern, but there
was no good starter documentation and a few bugs. There is a [getting started][s13-getting-started]
guide now! Also, a ton of new features have been added in the last month:

- ImGui support
- Mac support
- Shader specialization

For more details, see the [changelog][s13-change-log].
