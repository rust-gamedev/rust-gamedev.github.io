Welcome to the 25th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Vehicle Evolver Deluxe]

_Vehicle Evolver Deluxe in action!_

[Vehicle Evolver Deluxe]
([GitHub](https://github.com/Bauxitedev/vehicle_evolver_deluxe),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/bauxitedev/status/1423916614651678722)) by
[@bauxitedev] is a simulation that runs in your browser, using AI (to be
specific: [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm))
to try to build better and better vehicles. The vehicles have to overcome an
obstacle course, starting with some slight hills, followed by steeper hills, and
finally some jumps. The vehicles are made out of panels and wheels, connected
together, similar to the game
[Besiege](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/), except in 2D. It
was built using Rust and the Bevy game engine.

[Try the live web demo
here.](https://bauxitedev.github.io/vehicle_evolver_deluxe/index.html) (It needs
a relatively fast computer, on mobile browsers it'll run really slow.)

[There is also an in-depth explanation available on how it works internally, in
the form of an educational video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRNdCCSSyo)
