Welcome to the 38th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Take a little break to relax and draw some sand art_

[Graviton](https://www.gravitongame.art/) by [@hakolao](https://github.com/hakolao)

with gravity.

The game is going to be released in early access on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2137280/Graviton__A_Relaxing_Sand_Simulation/?utm_source=rust_gamedev&utm_medium=web) during this October.
