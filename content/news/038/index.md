Welcome to the 38th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Making a turn-based multiplayer game in Rust][tbs-tutrial-1]

@herluf-ba published a beginner friendly [3 part tutorial series][tbs-tutrial-1]
about making turn-based multiplayer games using rust.
It covers what games can be considered "turn-based",
how to write a simple but neat game server using [renet],
and finally how to tie it all together with a client app made with [bevy].
