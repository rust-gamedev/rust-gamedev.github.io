Welcome to the 38th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

CyberGate ([YouTube][cybergate-yt], [Discord][cybergate-dis]) by CyberSoul
is an attempt to use artificial intelligence to build diverse universe experiences with strange creatures and procedural gameplay styles.
We are on the Phase 5.2 of the project (analogously version 0.5.2), and we finalized a playable game with the tech we have developed until now.

Recent updates:

- My own Networking Reliability and Package aggregation over WebRTC
- Implemented Winit background process on all browsers
- Introduced Grabbing and Building Mechanics
- Created enemy AI that groups and flies in colonies. Includes a deadly night mode
- Usernames and life points with Fontdue.rs
- Menu and leaderboard using yakui.rs
- Improved the Automation to push Server Updates
- Improved wasm related performance, latency, and connection freezing bugs.

[Join the Discord server][cybergate-dis] to participate in upcoming Phase 6.0!
