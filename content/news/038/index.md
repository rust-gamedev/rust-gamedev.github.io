Welcome to the 38th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Ultimechs]

![Ultimechs - let the games begin](ultimechs.png)

[Ultimechs]
([Discord](https://discord.com/invite/srX92DRt9G),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ultimechs),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Ultimechs/),
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultimechs/),
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6t6delBJRxnaBcqBPpC3Gg))
by [Resolution Games](https://www.resolutiongames.com)
is a future sports game played with mechs.
It is VR, multiplayer, and free to play.

Ultimechs is partially written in Rust.
The Rust code is for the core of the game, including the game rules,
networking, and physics (that use [Rapier]).
The rest of the game, including the graphics, audio, user input,
and everything that happens outside the arena,
is made in [Unity](https://unity.com/).

The game was released on the 15th of September
on the [Meta Quest 2][ultimechs-quest] and [SteamVR][ultimechs-steamvr].

There is [a conference talk][ultimechs-talk]
and [a blog post][ultimechs-post]
about the choice of Rust and how they combined Rust with the studio's
standard tools Unity and C#.
[Another blog post][ultimechs-post-2]
goes into more depth about calling Rust code from C# in Unity.

## Engine Updates

### [godot-rust][gd-github]

![godot-rust new export syntax](godot-rust-export.png)
_The new `#[method]` syntax, which replaces existing `#[export]` and allows omitting
the base parameter._

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot engine.
In September, development was divided into three tasks:

- Maintenance releases [0.10.1][gd-0.10.1] and [0.10.2][gd-0.10.2]
- Godot 3.5 support in v0.11 ([#910][gd-910])
- Ongoing [GDExtension][gd-gdext] efforts ([#824][gd-824])

Besides support for Godot 3.5.1, a change that many users will notice is the
new `#[method]` + `#[base]` syntax, replacing `#[export]` as illustrated above.

The GDExtension/Rust binding has finally reached a state where a first
experimental version is within reach in October. If you are fine with the
bugs and missing features, you can give it a try very soon!

## Learning Material Updates

### [Making a turn-based multiplayer game in Rust][tbs-tutrial-1]

![A screenshot of the tic tac toe clone the tutorial covers](tbs-multiplayer-tutorial.png)

@herluf-ba published a beginner friendly [3 part tutorial series][tbs-tutrial-1]
about making turn-based multiplayer games using rust.
It covers what games can be considered "turn-based",
how to write a simple but neat game server using [renet],
and finally how to tie it all together with a client app made with [bevy].
