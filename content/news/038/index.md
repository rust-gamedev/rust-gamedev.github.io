Welcome to the 38th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [godot-rust][gd-github]

![godot-rust new export syntax](godot-rust-export.png)
_The new `#[method]` syntax, which replaces existing `#[export]` and allows omitting
the base parameter._

godot-rust ([GitHub][gd-github], [Discord][gd-discord], [Twitter][gd-twitter])
is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot engine.
In September, development was divided into three tasks:

- Maintenance releases [0.10.1][gd-0.10.1] and [0.10.2][gd-0.10.2]
- Godot 3.5 support in v0.11 ([#910][gd-910])
- Ongoing [GDExtension][gd-gdext] efforts ([#824][gd-824])

Besides support for Godot 3.5.1, a change that many users will notice is the
new `#[method]` + `#[base]` syntax, replacing `#[export]` as illustrated above.

The GDExtension/Rust binding has finally reached a state where a first
experimental version is within reach in October. If you are fine with the
bugs and missing features, you can give it a try very soon!
