Welcome to the 46th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### Digital Extinction

![Building Placement in Digital Extinction](digital-extinction.jpeg)
_Building Placement in Digital Extinction_

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],
[Reddit][de-reddit]) by [@Indy2222] is a 3D real-time strategy game made with
[Bevy].

The most notable updates are:

- poles at unit manufacturing delivery locations for selected factories,
- pausing unit manufacturing when spawn location is occupied,
- [IME][ime] support for text boxes,
- a lot of progress on multiplayer networking,
- [logging][de-logging] to file and other logging improvements.

Support for multiplayer is a technologically complex problem to solve and it is
the last major missing feature before the [proof-of-concept][de-poc] version
can be released. Therefore, a lot of effort currently goes in this direction.

The game is slowly gaining traction in the development community.
Check out our new [contributors here][de-contributors].

See [gameplay][de-video] screen recordings on YouTube.

More detailed monthly updates are available [here (May)][de-update-07] and
[here (June)][de-update-08].

### [Tunnet][tunnet-itch]

![Tunnet screenshot: robots queueing outside nightclub](tunnet.jpg)
_Connecting the DJ set to the network_

Tunnet ([Steam][tunnet-steam], [Itch.io][tunnet-itch]) is a short
puzzle/exploration game where the player digs tunnels and connects computers
together.

As a network engineer, the player will also have to respond to security
incidents.
In May, this game mechanic has been illustrated in a [devlog][tunnet-post] and
a preview of the new [basic water simulation][tunnet-water] has been posted.

### [Fish Folk's Kickstarter][fish-ks]

![happy fish, exploding bombs, "thank you!" written in the central explosion
and "just founded" in the bottom](folk-funded.png)

This month [Fish Folk][fish-jumpy] ([itch.io][fish-itch], [Discord][fish-dis])
has launched their [Kickstarter campaign][fish-ks]
that has [already reached its funding goal][fish-15k]!

Even though the basic sum is collected, the campaign continues till June 23
and you may still participate in it because of the stretch goals:

> The plan for how to allocate funds that exceed our â‚¬15k goal is very simple:
> For every additional â‚¬1,000 pledged to our campaign,
> we will prototype another fishy game archetype for our evergrowing bundle.
> Once our funding run concludes we will poll our backers on which game(s)
> you would like us to prioritize.

### [How to Migrate Your Bevy Projects with (Semi-)Automation][bevy-migrate]

![Logos with ast-grep and bevy](migrate-bevy.png)

[@HerringtonDarkholme] published an [article][bevy-migrate]
about how to make Bevy migration easier by using git, cargo and [ast-grep].
The article uses the utility AI library [big-brain] as an example
to illustrate bumping the Bevy version from 0.9 to 0.10
and covers four big steps: making a clean git branch,
updating the dependencies, running fix commands, and fixing failing tests.
By using semi-automation tools, you can migrate your Bevy projects
with less hassle and more confidence.

### [Rerun][rerun]

![Rerun showing 3D object detections in a 2D view](rerun3d2d.gif)

[Rerun][rerun] ([Discord][rerun-dis], [Github][rerun-gh])
is an open-source SDK for logging complex visual data paired with a visualizer
for exploring that data over time. While its primary focus is on robotics and
computer vision, it can be useful for all kinds of
rapid prototyping & algorithm development.

Rerun was shown at the Rust GameDev meetup,
watch the recording [here][rerun-meetup-vid].

[v0.6.0][rerun-v0-6-0] is out now! A few of the biggest highlights:

- You can now show 3D objects in 2D views connected by Pinhole transforms.
- You can quickly view images and meshes with `rerun mesh.obj image.png`.
- The correct to install the rerun binary is now `cargo install rerun-cli`.
- native_viewer is now an opt-in feature of the rerun library,
  leading to faster compilation times.
- SDK log calls are now batched on the wire, saving CPU time and bandwidth.
- [Experimental WebGPU support][rerun-wgpu].

There's a growing community on [Discord][rerun-dis]
waiting for you to join in case you have any questions,
comments or just want to follow the latest development.
The [Github project][rerun-gh] is MIT/Apache
licensed and open to contribute for everyone,
be it with suggestions, bugs or PRs.

## Library Updates

### [blit]

![blit example: blitting the full sprite](blit.png)

[blit] is a GPL licensed library for quickly blitting 2D images on a pixel buffer.
After a long stale period development has resumed quite a bit
in the last couple of months.

The previous big release, [v0.7.0][blit-0-7], saw a big improvement in performance
and API ergonomics. It also introduced interactive WebAssembly examples
[which can be seen here][blit-web-show].

The latest big release, [v0.8.0][blit-0-8], is a complete rewrite of the quite old
and admittendly outdated API. A focus has been put on both ergonomics and performance.
There's now many ways of drawing a subsection, tiling, masking and creating
repeating slices of an image on a pixel buffer.

[blit-0-7]: https://github.com/tversteeg/blit/releases/tag/v0.7.0
[blit-0-8]: https://github.com/tversteeg/blit/releases/tag/v0.8.0

### [seldom_state]

[seldom_state] is a Bevy plugin that adds a `StateMachine` component that you
can add to your entities. The state machine will change the entity's components
based on states, triggers, and transitions that you define. It's useful
for player controllers, animations, simple AI, etc.

This month, [seldom_state] 0.6 was released:

- Triggers don't need to be registered!
- `MachineState` and `Trigger` no longer require `Reflect`
- `StateMachine`'s `trans_builder` accepts the current state in the closure, so
  you have dataflow between states!
- You may add and remove state components manually
- More versatile `on_enter` and `on_exit` events
- `Trigger` combinators `not`, `and`, and `or`
- Transitions have priority in the order they are added
- You can use `EventReader`, `Local`, etc in your triggers!
- Added an `EventTrigger<E>` that triggers on an event
- `StateMachine`'s `set_trans_logging` sets whether to log state transitions
- [And more][changelog]!

### [Kira]

[Kira] ([GitHub]) by [@tesselode] is a backend-agnostic library to create
expressive audio for games.

Kira v0.8 adds support for spatial audio, global modulation sources for
easier and more powerful parameter tweening, compressor and EQ effects,
and more powerful playback and loop region settings.
