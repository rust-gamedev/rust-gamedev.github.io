Welcome to the 46th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### Digital Extinction

![Building Placement in Digital Extinction](digital-extinction.jpeg)
_Building Placement in Digital Extinction_

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],
[Reddit][de-reddit]) by [@Indy2222] is a 3D real-time strategy game made with
[Bevy].

The most notable updates are:

- poles at unit manufacturing delivery locations for selected factories,
- pausing unit manufacturing when the spawn location is occupied,
- [IME][ime] support for text boxes,
- a lot of progress on multiplayer networking,
- [logging][de-logging] to file and other logging improvements.

Support for multiplayer is a technologically complex problem to solve and it is
the last major missing feature before the [proof-of-concept][de-poc] version
can be released. Therefore, a lot of effort currently goes in this direction.

The game is slowly gaining traction in the development community.
Check out our new [contributors here][de-contributors].

See [gameplay][de-video] screen recordings on YouTube.

More detailed monthly updates are available [here (May)][de-update-07] and

### [Fish Folk's Kickstarter][fish-ks]

![happy fish, exploding bombs, "thank you!" written in the central explosion
and "just founded" in the bottom](folk-funded.png)

This month [Fish Folk][fish-folk] ([itch.io][fish-itch], [Discord][fish-dis])
has launched their [Kickstarter campaign][fish-ks]
that has [already reached its funding goal][fish-15k]!

Even though the basic sum is collected, the campaign still continues
to get more funds for the stretch goals:

> The plan for how to allocate funds that exceed our â‚¬15k goal is very simple:
> For every additional â‚¬1,000 pledged to our campaign,
> we will prototype another fishy game archetype for our evergrowing bundle.
> Once our funding run concludes we will poll our backers on which game(s)
> you would like us to prioritize.

### [How to Migrate Your Bevy Projects with (Semi-)Automation][bevy-migrate]

![Logos with ast-grep and bevy](migrate-bevy.png)

[@HerringtonDarkholme] published an [article][bevy-migrate]
about how to make Bevy migration easier by using git, cargo and [ast-grep].
The article uses the utility AI library [big-brain] as an example
to illustrate bumping the Bevy version from 0.9 to 0.10
and covers four big steps: making a clean git branch,
updating the dependencies, running fix commands, and fixing failing tests.
By using semi-automation tools, you can migrate your Bevy projects
with less hassle and more confidence.

## Library Updates

### [blit]

![blit example: blitting the full sprite](blit.png)

[blit] is a GPL licensed library for quickly blitting 2D images on a pixel buffer.
After a long stale period development has resumed quite a bit
in the last couple of months.

The previous big release, [v0.7.0][blit-0-7], saw a big improvement in performance
and API ergonomics. It also introduced interactive WebAssembly examples
[which can be seen here][blit-web-show].

The latest big release, [v0.8.0][blit-0-8], is a complete rewrite of the quite old
and admittendly outdated API. A focus has been put on both ergonomics and performance.
There's now many ways of drawing a subsection, tiling, masking and creating
repeating slices of an image on a pixel buffer.

### [seldom_state]

[seldom_state] is a Bevy plugin that adds a `StateMachine` component that you
can add to your entities. The state machine will change the entity's components
based on states, triggers, and transitions that you define. It's useful
for player controllers, animations, simple AI, etc.

This month, [seldom_state] 0.6 was released:

- Triggers don't need to be registered!
- MachineState and Trigger no longer require Reflect.
- StateMachine's trans_builder accepts the current state in the closure, so
  you have dataflow between states!
- You may add and remove state components manually.
- More versatile on_enter and on_exit events.
- Trigger combinators `not`, `and`, and `or`.
- Transitions have priority in the order they are added.
- You can use EventReader, Local, etc in your triggers!
- Added an `EventTrigger<E>` that triggers on an event.
- StateMachine's set_trans_logging sets whether to log state transitions
- [And more][changelog]!
