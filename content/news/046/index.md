Welcome to the 46th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [seldom_state]

[seldom_state] is a Bevy plugin that adds a `StateMachine` component that you
can add to your entities. The state machine will change the entity's components
based on states, triggers, and transitions that you define. It's useful
for player controllers, animations, simple AI, etc.

This month, [seldom_state] 0.6 was released:

- Triggers don't need to be registered!
- `MachineState` and `Trigger` no longer require `Reflect`
- `StateMachine`'s `trans_builder` accepts the current state in the closure, so
  you have dataflow between states!
- You may add and remove state components manually
- More versatile `on_enter` and `on_exit` events
- `Trigger` combinators `not`, `and`, and `or`
- Transitions have priority in the order they are added
- You can use `EventReader`, `Local`, etc in your triggers!
- Added an `EventTrigger<E>` that triggers on an event
- `StateMachine`'s `set_trans_logging` sets whether to log state transitions
- [And more][changelog]!
