Welcome to the 46th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Digital Extinction

_Building Placement in Digital Extinction_

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],
[Reddit][de-reddit]) by [@Indy2222] is a 3D real-time strategy game made with
[Bevy].

The most notable updates are:

* poles at unit manufacturing delivery locations for selected factories,
* pausing unit manufacturing when spawn location is occupied,
* [IME][ime] support for text boxes,
* a lot of progress on multiplayer networking,
* [logging][de-logging] to file and other logging
  improvements.

Support for multiplayer is a technologically complex problem to solve and it is
the last major missing feature before the [proof-of-concept][de-poc] version
can be released. Therefore, a lot of effort currently goes in this direction.

The game is slowly gaining traction in the development community. Check out our
new [contributors here][de-contributors].

See [gameplay][de-video] screen recordings on YouTube.

More detailed monthly updates are available [here (May)][de-update-07] and
[here (June)][de-update-08].
