_Building Placement in Digital Extinction_

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],
[Reddit][de-reddit]) by [@Indy2222] is a 3D real-time strategy game made with
[Bevy].

This month the game had two new first time contributors, [@0HyperCube] and
[@Polostor] (Péťa Tománek).

The most notable updates are:

- several multiplayer related screens were added to the menu: sign-in /
  sign-up, game listing, and game creation,
- building draft is now semi-transparent and colored green or red based on
  obstacles,
- double clicking on a unit or building leads to the selection of all visible
  entities of the same type,
- the mouse cursor is now confined to the game window,
- the camera can be moved horizontally with arrow keys,
- pop-up in-game menu was added, it is opened with Escape key,
- work on game head-up display / panel (HUD) was initiated,
- various errors are now briefly displayed as toasts in the UI,
- support of map hashing was added and deterministic map paths are used,
- several small fixes, code quality improvements.

See [gameplay][video-game] and [menu][video-menu] screen recordings on YouTube.

### [Cargo Space]

![Screenshot of p2p multiplayer in Cargo Space: One instance running on windows
and one in Chrome](cargo-space-cross-platform.png)
_Cross-platform p2p multiplayer in Cargo Space_

[Cargo Space] ([Discord][cargospace_discord]) by
[@johanhelsing][johanhelsing_mastodon] is a co-op 2d space game where you build
a ship and fly it through space looking for new parts, fighting pirates and the
environment.

This month, sprites were added for basic character poses, as well as basic sound
effects, making the game come alive and feel more like a proper 2D platformer.

Support for [`bevy_ggrs`][bevy_ggrs]' synctest sessions was implemented. This
allows detecting de-syncs by constantly performing rollbacks and comparing world
state checksums). This caught some very rare de-sync bugs.

The game also adopted [Matchbox][cargospace_matchbox]' newly added support for
cross-platform p2p. Which means sessions between players on web and native
are now supported ([video][cargospace_cross_platform_video]).

All of this is discussed in detail the [third devlog
entry][cargospace_devlog_3].

Johan also wrote [an article][cargospace_devlog_4] on how sound effects were
implemented in a rollback-aware way, cancelling mis-predicted sounds, and
handling "late" sounds. It describes a solution that could easily be adopted for
any game made with [`bevy_ggrs`][bevy_ggrs].

## Tooling Updates

### [Foxtrot]

![Foxtrot in action](foxtrot.gif)

[Foxtrot] was created by [@janhohenheim] as an all-in-one starting point for 3D
projects made in Bevy. While he appreciated that other Bevy templates showed
nicely how to wire up systems and setup a game loop, he was missing a showcase
for commonly used features that are scattered around various libraries. So he created
Foxtrot, where he collected most basic features he could need for future
projects or jams. The current version [v0.1.5] features:

- loading a 3D level from GLTF files
- automatically assigning physics colliders
- a custom dialog system
- saving and loading the game
- a force-based third-person character controller
- shaders
- pathfinding
- a flexible camera system with easings
- a custom ingame editor window for live tweaks such as spawning new objects.

### [Graphite][graphite-website]

![Graphite logo](graphite.png)

Graphite ([website][graphite-website], [GitHub][graphite-repo],
[Discord][graphite-discord], [Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is a free,
in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor based around a Rust-powered
node graph compositing engine.

New features from January's [sprint 22][graphite-sprint-22]:

- _Picture This:_ Imported images are now part of the node graph. The new
  _Image Frame_ node converts bitmap data into a vector rectangle holding the
  image. This paves the way for other vector data like shapes and text to soon
  be converted into nodes and composited alongside images.
- _Instant Iterations:_ Incremental graph compilation avoids recompiling the
  whole graph each time an edit is made or a value changes. This makes
  iteration faster and enables caching of intermediate computations for faster
  rendering.

Later this month, the Alpha Milestone 2 release will launch with new node graph
features, a revamped website, and a wider-reaching project announcement. Join
the [newsletter][graphite-newsletter] and stay tuned.

## Library Updates

### [big-brain]

[big-brain] ([GitHub][big-brain-github], [Discord][big-brain-discord]) by [@zkat]
is a highly-parallel [Utility AI][big-brain-utility-ai] library
for the Bevy game engine.

[big-brain] recently tagged [v0.16.0][big-brain-v16],
bringing with it a couple of breaking changes and a few goodies.

Probably the biggest change in this release is removal of the blanket
[`ActionBuilder`][big-brain-action-builder] and [`ScorerBuilder`][big-brain-scorer-builder]
implementations for `Clone` types. This is a fairly significant breaking change,
but one that is fairly easy to resolve: simply use the new `#[derive(ActionBuilder)]`
and `#[derive(ScorerBuilder)]` macros to derive the necessary implementations
for your Action and Scorer Components and you should be good to go.

Finally, since the recent [merging of the bevy scheduler changes][big-brain-bevy-scheduler-changes],
big-brain users should expect the next version of big-brain to bring with it
some significant breaking changes to scheduling, so keep an eye out for that
and be mindful of building a lot on top of the current [`BigBrainStage`][big-brain-stage]
(which is used by the default `BigBrainPlugin`).

_Video: an example of realtime MIDI synthesis with RustySynth on rust-sfml_
][rustysynth-video]

[RustySynth] is a SoundFont MIDI synthesizer written in pure Rust.
The purpose of this library is to provide MIDI music playback functionality
for any Rust application without complicated dependencies.
The code base is lightweight and can be used with any audio driver
that supports streaming audio (e.g. [rust-sfml]).

Features:

- Tuned mainly for gamedev and has low CPU usage.
- Support for standard MIDI files.
- No dependencies other than the standard library.
- Available under a permissive license (MIT).

### [tween]

`tween` is a library for manipulating values in stylish and beautiful ways.
It has been almost entirely rewritten for `v2.0.0`, now featuring a
significantly improved API, fewer generics, and much, much faster performance.

Additionally, it has added support for Looping, Oscillating, and Extrapolating tweens.
With all of this, making custom tweens is much easier. An example of making a Bezier
tween is included.

### [scene-graph]

`scene-graph` is a library for creating graph structures similar to the
one used in engines like Unity or Unreal. It is fast, performant, and easy to
manipulate. It's especially useful for user interfaces. Although only in `v0.1.0`,
feedback would be very appreciated.

### [torchbearer]

![Torchbearer in action](torchbearer.png)
_An exemple of torchbearer in action,
demonstrating both pathfinding and field of view_

[torchbearer] by [@redwarp] is a library that provides a set of tools
to find your path in a grid based dungeon. Specifically,
it provide a quick implementation of pathfinding and field of view algorithm.

The 0.6.x version rewrites the field of view algorithm to cast vision rays
in a bresenham circle around the point of origin.
This change from its [original implementation][torchbearer-orig] makes it faster
as it removes the needs for error correction.

### [Matchbox]

![matchbox logo](matchbox.png)

[Matchbox] is a library for easily establishing unreliable, unordered,
peer-to-peer WebRTC data connections using rust WASM. This enables low-latency
multiplayer browser games.

Originally, it was written for web assembly, but a native implementation using
[WebRTC.rs] has been available since 0.4. However, a few minor incompatibilities
between the two implementations meant connections between native and web
were not possible.

In version 0.5, however, [Alex Rozgo] fixed the the last of these issues. And
cross-play sessions are now finally fully supported.

In addition, [johanhelsing][johanhelsing_mastodon] fixed a serious bug that used
to cause disconnections on recent versions of Firefox.

The tutorial series on [how to make a p2p web game with Bevy, GGRS and
Matchbox][extreme_bevy] was also updated to the latest versions of all three
libraries.
