## Game Updates

### Digital Extinction

{{ image_figure(
    alt="Building Placement in Digital Extinction"
    src="digital-extinction.jpeg"
    caption="Building Placement in Digital Extinction") }}

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],
[Reddit][de-reddit]) by [@Indy2222] is a 3D real-time strategy game made with
[Bevy].

This month the game had two new first-time contributors, [@0HyperCube] and
[@Polostor] (Péťa Tománek).

The most notable updates are:

- several multiplayer related screens were added to the menu: sign-in / sign-up,
  game listing, and game creation,
- building draft is now semi-transparent and colored green or red based on
  obstacles,
- double clicking on a unit or building leads to the selection of all visible
  entities of the same type,
- the mouse cursor is now confined to the game window,
- the camera can be moved horizontally with arrow keys,
- pop-up in-game menu was added, it is opened with Escape key,
- work on game head-up display / panel (HUD) was initiated,
- various errors are now briefly displayed as toasts in the UI,
- support of map hashing was added and deterministic map paths are used,
- several small fixes, and code quality improvements.

See [gameplay][video-game] and [menu][video-menu] screen recordings on YouTube.

### [Cargo Space]

{{ image_figure(
    alt="Screenshot of p2p multiplayer in Cargo Space: One instance running on windows
and one in Chrome"
    src="cargo-space-cross-platform.png"
    caption="Cross-platform p2p multiplayer in Cargo Space") }}

[Cargo Space] ([Discord][cargospace_discord]) by
[@johanhelsing][johanhelsing_mastodon] is a co-op 2d space game where you build
a ship and fly it through space looking for new parts, fighting pirates and the
environment.

This month, sprites were added for basic character poses, as well as basic sound
effects, making the game come alive and feel more like a proper 2D platformer.

Support for [`bevy_ggrs`][bevy_ggrs]' synctest sessions was implemented. This
allows detecting de-syncs by constantly performing rollbacks and comparing world
state checksums). This caught some very rare de-sync bugs.

The game also adopted [Matchbox][cargospace_matchbox]'s newly added support for
cross-platform p2p. This means sessions between players on web and native are
now supported ([video][cargospace_cross_platform_video]).

All of this is discussed in detail in the [third devlog
entry][cargospace_devlog_3].

Johan also wrote [an article][cargospace_devlog_4] on how sound effects were
implemented in a rollback-aware way, canceling mispredicted sounds, and handling
"late" sounds. It describes a solution that could easily be adopted for any game
made with [`bevy_ggrs`][bevy_ggrs].

### [Idu][idu-itch]

{{ image_figure(
    alt="Screenshot of a tree emerging from a cave in Idu"
    src="idu-newsletter.jpg"
    caption="Screenshot of a tree emerging from a cave in Idu") }}

[Idu][idu-itch] ([Discord][idu_discord]) Idu is a strategic sandbox game about growing
plants that wish to reclaim nature, developed by [Elina
Shakhnovich][eli_mastodon] and [Johann Tael][johann_mastodon] featuring a
bespoke Vulkan-based engine in Rust.

After almost a whole year of relative silence, they have begun releasing new
demos in January. The new demo version 8 comes with a new renderer supporting
interactive, flowing water. Also, the simulated trees in Idu changed a lot, as
they're now able to flower, in addition to dropping leaves. The new demo
features a lot of new plant textures, branching logic, and better rhizome and
root simulation.

Player accessibility and the gameplay itself is better now as well, due to a
completely new menu and a lot of new items, such as porous gabion blocks and
ladders.

Read more and download the newest demo from [Idu's page on itch.io][idu-itch].

### [Veloren][veloren]

{{ image_figure(
    alt="A river with flora and fauna"
    src="veloren.jpg"
    caption="A serene river with new reflections") }}

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In January, Veloren released version 0.14! This update included trading with
pets, musical instrument crafting, the Sea Chapel, and many more changes. You
can read all about that update in the [release post][veloren-0.14].

Veloren's Site2 system can now be hot-reloaded. Site2 allows you to describe
procedures for how objects like houses, trees, or bridges should be generated.
Hot-reloading allows you to change the Site2 code and watch the changes take
effect in real-time. The official 2023 Veloren OST was also released, and can be
[watched on YouTube][veloren-ost].

## Learning Material Updates

### [Introduction to the Entity Component System][tut-ecs-intro]

![Title card: Introduction to the Entity Component System](intro-ecs.png)

[@indiedevcasts] published [a new blog post][tut-ecs-intro], exploring
object-oriented and data-oriented designs before giving an introduction to the
Entity Component System paradigm.

## Tooling Updates

### [Foxtrot]

![Foxtrot in action](foxtrot.gif)

[Foxtrot] was created by Jan Hohenheim ([@janhohenheim]) as an all-in-one
starting point for 3D projects made in Bevy. While he appreciated that other
Bevy templates showed nicely how to wire up systems and setup a game loop, he
was missing a showcase for commonly used features that are scattered around
various libraries. So he created Foxtrot, where he collected the most basic
features he could need for future projects or jams. The [latest release]
features:

- loading a 3D level from GLTF files
- automatically assigning physics colliders
- a custom dialog system
- saving and loading the game
- a force-based third-person character controller
- shaders
- pathfinding
- a flexible camera system with easings supporting various perspectives
- a custom in-game editor window for live tweaks such as spawning new objects.

### [Graphite][graphite-website]

![Graphite logo](graphite.png)

Graphite ([website][graphite-website], [GitHub][graphite-repo],
[Discord][graphite-discord], [Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is a free,
in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor based around a Rust-powered
node graph compositing engine.

New features from January's [sprint 22][graphite-sprint-22]:

- Picture this: Imported images are now part of the node graph. The new _Image
  Frame_ node converts bitmap data into a vector rectangle holding the image.
  This paves the way for other vector data like shapes and text to soon be
  converted into nodes and composited alongside images.
- Instant iterations: Incremental graph compilation avoids recompiling the
  whole graph each time an edit is made or a value changes. This makes iteration
  faster and enables caching of intermediate computations for faster rendering.

And soon, the Alpha Milestone 2 release will launch with new node graph
features, a revamped website, and a wider-reaching project announcement. Join
the [newsletter][graphite-newsletter] and stay tuned.

## Library Updates

### [big-brain]

[big-brain] ([GitHub][big-brain-github], [Discord][big-brain-discord]) by
[@zkat] is a highly parallel [Utility AI][big-brain-utility-ai] library for the
Bevy game engine.

[big-brain] recently tagged [v0.16.0][big-brain-v16], bringing with it a couple
of breaking changes and a few goodies.

Probably the biggest change in this release is the removal of the blanket
[`ActionBuilder`][big-brain-action-builder] and
[`ScorerBuilder`][big-brain-scorer-builder] implementations for `Clone` types.
This is a fairly significant breaking change, but one that is fairly easy to
resolve: simply use the new `#[derive(ActionBuilder)]` and
`#[derive(ScorerBuilder)]` macros to derive the necessary implementations for
your Action and Scorer Components and you should be good to go.

Finally, since the recent [merging of the bevy scheduler
changes][big-brain-bevy-scheduler-changes], big-brain users should expect the
next version of big-brain to bring with it some significant breaking changes to
scheduling, so keep an eye out for that and be mindful of building a lot on top
of the current [`BigBrainStage`][big-brain-stage] (which is used by the default
`BigBrainPlugin`).

### [RustySynth]

{{ image_figure(
    alt="Waveform displayed on a screen"
    src="rustysynth-yt.png"
    caption="Video: an example of realtime MIDI synthesis with RustySynth on rust-sfml",
    link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9rPTJIPmVk") }}

[RustySynth] is a SoundFont MIDI synthesizer written in pure Rust. The purpose
of this library is to provide MIDI music playback functionality for any Rust
application without complicated dependencies. The code base is lightweight and
can be used with any audio driver that supports streaming audio (e.g.
[rust-sfml]).

Features:

- Tuned mainly for gamedev and has low CPU usage.
- Support for standard MIDI files.
- No dependencies other than the standard library.
- Available under a permissive license (MIT).

### [tween]

`tween` is a library for manipulating values in stylish and beautiful ways. It
has been almost entirely rewritten for `v2.0.0`, now featuring a significantly
improved API, fewer generics, and much, much faster performance.

Additionally, it has added support for Looping, Oscillating, and Extrapolating
tweens. With all of this, making custom tweens is much easier. An example of
making a Bezier tween is included.

[tween]: https://github.com/sanbox-irl/tween

### [scene-graph]

`scene-graph` is a library for creating graph structures similar to the one used
in engines like Unity or Unreal. It is fast, performant, and easy to manipulate.
It's especially useful for user interfaces. Although only in `v0.1.0`, feedback
would be very appreciated.

### [torchbearer]

{{ image_figure(
    alt="Torchbearer in action"
    src="torchbearer.png"
    caption="An exemple of torchbearer in action, demonstrating both pathfinding and field
of view") }}

[torchbearer] by [@redwarp] is a library that provides a set of tools to find
your path in a grid-based dungeon. Specifically, it provides a quick
implementation of pathfinding and field of view algorithm.

The 0.6.x version rewrites the field of view algorithm to cast vision rays in a
Bresenham circle around the point of origin. This change from its [original
implementation][torchbearer-orig] makes it faster as it removes the needs for
error correction.

### [Matchbox]

![matchbox logo](matchbox.png)

[Matchbox] is a library for easily establishing unreliable, unordered,
peer-to-peer WebRTC data connections using rust WASM. This enables low-latency
multiplayer browser games.

Originally, it was written for web assembly, but a native implementation using
[WebRTC.rs] has been available since 0.4. However, a few minor incompatibilities
between the two implementations meant connections between native and web were
not possible.

In version 0.5, however, [Alex Rozgo] fixed the last of these issues. And
cross-play sessions are now finally fully supported.

In addition, [johanhelsing][johanhelsing_mastodon] fixed a serious bug that used
to cause disconnections on recent versions of Firefox.

The tutorial series on [how to make a p2p web game with Bevy, GGRS and
Matchbox][extreme_bevy] was also updated to the latest versions of all three
libraries.

### [miniquad]

{{ image_figure(
    alt="miniquad ios"
    src="miniquad_metal.gif"
    caption="Miniquad/macroquad examples rendered by Metal API") }}

[miniquad] is a safe and cross-platform rendering library focused on portability
and low-end platform support.

This month metal backend [PR][miniquad_metal_pr] finally landed on miniquad!

It is not yet ready for any production use, but it is available on crates.io as
0.4.0-alpha.

With this change, miniquad support webgl1, gl2, gles2/gles3, gl3+, metal on web,
macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux.
