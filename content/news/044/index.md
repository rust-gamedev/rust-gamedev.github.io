Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Tarsila]

![Tarsila's UI](tarsila.png)
_Editor's UI_

Tarsila is a pixel art and spritesheet editor writen in Rust using
egui and macroquad, inspired by [Aseprite].
The first public release (0.1.0) has been published on March 18th,
with [basic features][tarsila-feats].

Since the publication not many new features have been added, mostly
bugfixes and an overhaul of the input system, in preparation for
configurable shortcuts (via a text file and later GUI).

In the [roadmap][tarsila-roadmap] for 0.2.0 are things like color
effects (change hue, saturation, etc.), ovals and circles, and more.

We welcome [contributions][tarsila-contrib]! Big thanks to contributors
@quiet-bear and @crumblingstatue.
