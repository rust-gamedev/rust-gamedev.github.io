Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Jumpy]

![Live Map Editing Example](jumpy.gif)
_Live Map Editing!_

[Jumpy] ([GitHub][Jumpy], [Discord][jumpy_discord], [Twitter][jumpy_twitter]) by
[Spicy Lobster][spicy_lobster] is a pixel-style, tactical 2D shooter with a fishy
theme.

In the last month, the first [MVP release][jumpy_v0.6.0] of Jumpy was made. The
release adds some major new features including a live map editor, critters,
extended player animations, and basic AI. Soon afterward [an update][jumpy_v0.6.1]
was made with revised maps and some important bug fixes.

Along with the release, they published a retrospective, sharing thoughts on some
of the lessons learned during development:
[Jumpy v0.6 Retrospective][jumpy_retrospective].

The efforts are now focused on getting network play implemented, with a two
player LAN proof-of-concept already working. The hope is to get the remaining
issues fixed and the already-developed online matchmaker connected before making
another release as soon as it's ready.
