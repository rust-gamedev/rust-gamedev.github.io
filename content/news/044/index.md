Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[ZOMBIE DEMO GAME] is a small third person zombie shooter by [@LPGhatguy] and
[@evaera] that released this month.

It features an astonishing 10 minutes of gameplay, a built-in level editor, and
zombies! It was produced in order to practice shipping a game and uses a custom
engine using wgpu, hecs, and lots of other great crates from the ecosystem.

ZOMBIE DEMO GAME is available for Windows and Linux
[on itch.io][ZOMBIE DEMO GAME] today.

### Shifting Chamber

![Shifting Chamber Screen shot](shifting_chamber.png)

Shifting Chamber ([itch.io][shifting-chamber-itch],
[Github][shifting-chamber-github]) is a simple tactics game where
player, instead of moving the character, manipulates the map around it.
The goal is to defeat the enemies by forcing them into hazardous
positions - since they cannot be attacked directly.

The game is in an early prototype / proof of concept phase.
It is written with a help of the Bevy engine.
There is currently only a WASM build (freely available on the itch.io)

### [Jumpy]

![Live Map Editing Example](jumpy.gif)
_Live Map Editing!_

[Jumpy] ([GitHub][Jumpy], [Discord][jumpy_discord], [Twitter][jumpy_twitter]) by
[Spicy Lobster][spicy_lobster] is a pixel-style, tactical 2D shooter with a fishy
theme.

In the last month, the first [MVP release][jumpy_v0.6.0] of Jumpy was made. The
release adds some major new features including a live map editor, critters,
extended player animations, and basic AI. Soon afterward [an update][jumpy_v0.6.1]
was made with revised maps and some important bug fixes.

Along with the release is a new blog post, sharing thoughts on some of the lessons
learned during development:
[Jumpy v0.6 Retrospective][jumpy_retrospective].

The efforts are now focused on getting network play implemented, with a two
player LAN proof-of-concept already working. The hope is to get the remaining
network issues fixed and the online matchmaker connected before making another
release as soon as it's ready.

### [Tunnet][tunnet-itch]

![Tunnet screenshot: a weird looking computer network](tunnet.jpg)
_Example of a puzzle in Tunnet_

Tunnet ([Steam][tunnet-steam], [Itch.io][tunnet-itch]) by
[@puzzled\_squid][puzzled_squid] is a short puzzle/exploration game where you
build a computer network in an underground complex.

This project is still WIP and a first [devlog][tunnet-post] has been
posted this month. The post describes the main gameplay loop as well as some
of the new environments recently added.

The game is developed using Bevy and is expected to be released late 2023.

## Engine Updates

### hotline

![hotline_client](hotline_rdg44.jpg)
 _hotline live coding client_

hotline ([GitHub], [Blog], [Twitter]) is a modern, high-performance, hot-reload
graphics engine written in Rust. It aims to provide low-level access to modern
graphics API features, while at the same time providing high-level ergonomic
optimizations.  

It uses Bevy's ECS so the focus can remain primarily on the graphics
architecture. Direct3D12 is the only supported platform, but the graphics API is
abstracted to account for future ports to Vulkan and Metal. The project is in
its early stages but already has a decent amount of features showcasing
different render strategies, async command buffer generation, plugin based
architecture, and hot-reload support for Rust code, HLSL shaders, and render
configs. It supports ImGui with docking and multiple windows, video decoding,
complex image loading (cubemaps, arrays, volumes), and more.

[@polymonster] has been live streaming development on [Twitch] with archives
available on [YouTube]. Recently they have been designing a bindless material
system.

## Learning Material Updates

### Developing an editor with egui

![Gif displaying the functionality of the editor](TheGrimsey-Editor.gif)

[@TheGrimsey] published a three-part series of articles about developing a Spell
Editor with egui.

- ["Databases & Editors (1/3)"] covers displaying egui windows & tables of
  entries.
- ["Editors (2/3): Editing entries"] elaborates on handling editing of entries &
  properties such as enums.
- Finally, ["Editors (3/3): Selection dialog & new entries"] talks about
  developing a selection dialog and creating new entries.

## Library Updates

### [`bevy_text_mode`]

![Screenshot of 1-bit sprites drawn using bevy_text_mode.](bevy_text_mode.png)

[`bevy_text_mode`] ([GitHub][bevy_text_mode-src]) by [yopox] is a Bevy plugin which
makes it possible to set the background and the foreground color of a texture atlas
sprite (built-in Bevy sprites only have a tint property).
This plugin is convenient when using 1-bit tilesets such as [MRMOTEXT].

The 0.1 release adds a `TextModeTextureAtlasSprite` component with
configurable background, foreground, x/y flip and opacity.
