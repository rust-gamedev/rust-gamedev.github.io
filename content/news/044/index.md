Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Example of a puzzle in Tunnet_

Tunnet ([Steam][tunnet-steam], [Itch.io][tunnet-itch]) by
[@puzzled\_squid][puzzled_squid] is a short puzzle/exploration game where you
build a computer network in an underground complex.

This project is still WIP and a first [devlog][tunnet-post] has been
posted this month. The post describes the main gameplay loop as well as some
of the new environments recently added.

The game is developed using Bevy and is expected to be released late 2023.
