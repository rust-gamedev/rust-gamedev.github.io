Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Building Placement in Digital Extinction_

[Digital Extinction] ([GitHub][de-github], [Discord][de-discord],

[Bevy].

The most notable updates are:

- simple unit manufacturing was added,
- game minimap was added,
- game end detection was implemented,
- shadows were enabled,
- the health of all units & buildings was decreased,
- the “Quit Game” button in the game menu leads to the main menu instead of the
  termination of the application,
- close button was added to all menu screens,
- maximum number of players was made configurable by each map,
- screen edge size for camera movement was decreased,
- malformed configuration does not lead to a crash but a toast with an error
  message is displayed.
- [Bevy] was upgraded to v0.10.
