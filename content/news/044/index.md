Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [`bevy_text_mode`]

![Screenshot of 1-bit sprites drawn using bevy_text_mode.](bevy_text_mode.png)

[`bevy_text_mode`] ([GitHub][bevy_text_mode-src]) by [yopox] is a Bevy plugin which
makes it possible to set the background and the foreground color of a texture atlas
sprite (built-in Bevy sprites only have a tint property).
This plugin is convenient when using 1-bit tilesets such as [MRMOTEXT].

The 0.1 release adds a `TextModeTextureAtlasSprite` component with
configurable background, foreground, x/y flip and opacity.
