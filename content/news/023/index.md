Welcome to the {TODO}th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Open Combat][opencombat]

[Open Combat][opencombat]
([/r/OpenCombatGame](https://reddit.com/r/OpenCombatGame),
[Discord](https://discord.gg/YD2V7XsBQZ),
[Forum](https://discourse.opencombat.bux.fr/))
is a real time tactical game directly inspired from
[Close Combat Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Combat_(series)).
The player takes control of soldier units and orders them to win the battles
from a top down 2D view.

The project recently started with Rust language after a Python language proof of
concept in 2017. More info is available at [opencombat.bux.fr][opencombat],
and you can find a
[presentation](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pxVgjBKXlIw) video and a game
making of [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3TOEZ7krhvI) on YouTube.
