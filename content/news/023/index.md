Welcome to the {TODO}th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Themengi]

![User highlighting objects in the game world and parsing the phrase
"dang puru rupuu kythengi" into the action "open", object "door", and mods
"red" and "left".](themengi.gif)
_Demonstration of natural language parser with temporary words and grammar._

[Themengi] ([Discord][themengi-discord], [Twitter][themengi-twitter])
is a puzzle adventure game where you learn an alien language,
with completely unknown words and grammar, to navigate the world
and find your way home.

This month the [first devlog][themengi-video] for
Themengi was published, discussing its natural language parser using
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, the choice to use Bevy, a texture
upscaling technique for faithful pixel art rendering, and implementing an
outline shader in the Bevy render pipeline.

### [Open Combat][opencombat]

[Open Combat][opencombat]
([/r/OpenCombatGame](https://reddit.com/r/OpenCombatGame),
[Discord](https://discord.gg/YD2V7XsBQZ),
[Forum](https://discourse.opencombat.bux.fr/))
is a real time tactical game directly inspired from
[Close Combat Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Combat_(series)).
The player takes control of soldier units and orders them to win the battles
from a top down 2D view.

The project recently started with Rust language after a Python language proof of
concept in 2017. More info is available at [opencombat.bux.fr][opencombat],
and you can find a
[presentation](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pxVgjBKXlIw) video and a game
making of [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3TOEZ7krhvI) on YouTube.

### [erupt]

![erupt logo](erupt.svg)

[erupt] by [@Friz64] provides bindings to the Vulkan API.

Since being last mentioned in the newsletter shortly after its release, erupt
has undergone significant development. The generator, erupt's heart, has been
rewritten from scratch with the aim to improve maintainability. On top of that,
many bugs were fixed, the function loader was rewritten and usability was
improved while always keeping up to date with the latest Vulkan Headers as best
as possible.

The ecosystem has gained traction, with many people using the crate for their
projects. Pure Rust Vulkan allocators with support for erupt have been released.
