### [The Hat Chooses the Wizard][hatchooseswizard]

![Level 1-4 of the game "The Hat Chooses the Wizard" running on a Game Boy
Advance](hatchooseswizard.jpg)
_Runs on real hardware!_

The Hat Chooses the Wizard is a 2D platformer for the Game Boy Advance.

It was made for this year's Game Maker's Toolkit (GMTK) game jam with the theme
joined together and came in the top 25% of over 5800 entries. The game plays
over 12 levels with the core mechanic being to throw your hat and then
accelerate towards it. You can play it on a web-based emulator embedded on the
[itch][hatchooseswizard] page.

The game is written in pure Rust and uses [agb][agblibrary] to
interface with the hardware. The library is designed to allow you to write games
without needing a detailed understanding of the hardware while still giving full
access to all of its capabilities. It is under active development with
plenty more features on the way.

You can find the source code for the game [here][hatchooseswizardsource] and all
feedback is welcome.

_Cute rice dumplings_

[Dango] ([GitHub][dango-github]) is a little multiplayer blob physics sandbox
made by [@ErnWong] as a tribute to the [Dango Daikazoku][dango-daikazoku] from
[Clannad]. It was made using various libraries from the Rust community,
including the [Bevy] game engine, the [NPhysics] physics engine, and the
[CrystalOrb] networking library. To avoid the costs of running a server, Dango
currently runs the server in the browser and generates a unique URL that lets
other players to join using WebRTC.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Cave run](veloren.png) _Turns out the cave wasn't empty_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In June, Veloren released 0.10. During the release party, some of the developers
joined a voice call to stream the game and answer some questions about
development. You can watch that stream [here][veloren-stream]. A lot of metrics
were recorded during the launch, and you can read about them in
[blog #124][veloren-124]. At peak, 118 players were playing at the same
time during the launch.

The plugins system received a tutorial about how to get started. Caves were
overhauled with lots of new content. Veloren has officially moved fully over to
wgpu, which you can read all about in [blog #125][veloren-125]. Work has been
done on hot reloading for easier access of assets in game. Lots of new models
were added to the game, and bosses in dungeons are being overhauled with more
skills to diversify combat.

### [Projectris][projectris]

![projectris](projectris.png)

[Projectris][projectris] is like Tetris, but in 2D and 3D at the same time.
As the 3D piece falls, you can manipulate it, but all that matters
are the shadows it casts on the 2D game boards on either side,
each of which is played independently.

While the full concept is already prototyped, there are still many features to
implement before this is a real game:
scoreboard, increasing fall speed, game over, JUICE.

[@bonsairobo] is not actively working on this, but is
[happy to accept PRs][projectris].

### [The Process]

![The new terrain editor in The Process](the_process.gif)
_Building the world, one voxel at a time_

[The Process] by @setzer22 is an upcoming game about factory building,
process management, and carrot production,
built with Rust using the Godot game engine!

In this month, the main focus has been towards the addition of a new terrain
editor to speed up the creation of game levels. Terrain meshes are built using
smooth voxels using the implementation in the [building
blocks](https://docs.rs/building_blocks_core) crate.

This month has seen the following changes and improvements:

- The new [terrain
  editor](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1406707803637551107), with a
  minimalistic GUI built in Godot itself.
- A new [island](https://gfycat.com/talkativeneatcatfish), fully made and
  procedurally textured with the new editor
- Implemented random factory maintenance
  [events](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1403986026402619393).
- Migration of several old GDScript code into Rust, using the ECS pattern, like
  the system for character
  [movement](https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1411410261651738635).

## Engine Updates

### thRustEngine - with simple shooter game demo

![thRustEngine screenshot](thrustengine_screenshot.jpg)

This is a simple descent/quake style shooter written to demo
[thRustEngine]. The current repo is a placeholder.

It loads wavefront.OBJ, and Quake1/Quake3 BSP worlds, converted to
an internal format for collision and rendering. It uses clustered
forward+ dynamic lighting and normal maps, and loads textures
asynchronously.

The future direction depends on community feedback (a public shared
crate is planned). The current intention is to find a few close
collaborators.

Demo videos: [free quake map demo], [custom map demo].

### [Graphite][graphite-repo]

![Geometric cherry tree](graphite-cherry-tree.png)
_Geometric cherry tree artwork by BillyDM, winner of last month's first
Graphite art contest_

Graphite ([GitHub][graphite-repo], [Discord][graphite-discord],
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/GraphiteEditor)) is an in-development vector and
raster graphics editor built on a non-destructive node-based workflow.

Since last newsletter, the editor has received the ability to select layers via
the layer panel and by clicking or dragging a box selection in the
viewport. Selected layers can be deleted, duplicated, and copy/pasted.

It is now possible to create, edit, and close multiple documents in their own
editor tabs. Additional frontend cleanup and polish has also improved many
parts of the editor experience.

Lastly, support for transforms was added to the layers and document, paving
the way for moving/scaling/rotating layers and the whole document within the
viewport.

[Try it right now in your browser.][graphite-live-demo] Graphite is making
rapid progress towards becoming a non-destructive, procedural graphics editor
suitable of replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. Please
[join the Discord][graphite-discord] - and consider asking for a tour of the
code and how you can help!

## Library Updates

### [backroll-rs] and [GGRS]

[backroll-rs] ([Discord](https://discord.gg/VuZhs9V),
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/backroll)) by [@james7132] and
[GGRS]([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ggrs)) by [@g_schup] are pure
Rust implementations of the [GGPO] rollback networking library.

![Evo Moment 37](rollback.jpg)
_[Evo Moment 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0):
Only offline or with rollback!_

Rollback networking is a peer-to-peer network technique designed to hide
network latency in fast-paced games with precise inputs. Traditional techniques
account for network transmission time by delaying the game execution, resulting
in a sluggish game-feel. Rollback uses input prediction and speculative
execution instead. Upon receiving inputs from remote clients, resimulation of
incorrect game states occurs. This allows for gameplay that "feels just
like offline". The open source standard for rollback netcode [GGPO] is used
in successful games like Skullgirls, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R or
Fightcade. For further explanation about rollback,
[click here](https://ki.infil.net/w02-netcode.html).

Two projects in Rust were independently created to provide a working
implementation as well as helpful resources for developers.
backroll-rs features an added abstraction for the transportation layer and
also provides a bevy plugin, [bevy-backroll]. GGRS replaces the
C-style callback API of GGPO with a simpler, more understandable control flow.
The authors of both libraries recommend backroll-rs for development,
as it is currently more actively collaborated on.
GGRS is recommended as a learning resource and entry point,
with a plethora of internal documentation and explanation.

The main requirement to make use of both presented libraries is determinism
in your game execution. Resimulation requires that the result of progressing
the game state depending on the given inputs yield the exact same results
every time. Additionally, you need to be able to load, save and progress
your gamestate without rendering the outcome.

If you are interested in integrating rollback networking into your game or
just want to chat with other rollback developers (not limited to Rust),
check out the [GGPO Developers Discord]!

### [CrystalOrb]

[![CrystalOrb demo animation](crystalorb.gif)][crystalorb-demo]
_Interactive [demo][crystalorb-demo] that uses the [Rapier] physics engine._

[CrystalOrb] by [@ErnWong] is a new networking library that aims to help
fast-paced client-server games synchronize their game state across multiple
clients. Just like [backroll-rs] and [GGRS], each CrystalOrb client predicts
the next game state without waiting for other remote players' inputs to arrive.
Unlike backroll-rs's and GGRS's peer-to-peer approach which only send input
data between its peers, CrystalOrb relies on having a server to send
authoritative snapshots of the entire game state to each client. In response,
each client unconditionally rolls-back to that snapshot. Although this may lead
to higher network and memory usage, it means that CrystalOrb clients can join
and leave at any time, and games that cannot guarantee full-determinism can
still work with CrystalOrb.

This library was written as a learning exercise for the author, and as such,
the author warns that this library may not be suitable for serious games.

There is an [interactive demo][crystalorb-demo] of CrystalOrb that features the
[Rapier] physics engine.

### [glutin] (and [winit])

![Animated image showing a window that is opened with a spinning cursor on top](winit-bug-1.gif)
_This cursor may be waiting [in vain], but your patience shall be rewarded._

[glutin] is a low-level library for OpenGL context creation, written in pure Rust.
[glutin] uses and re-exports [winit], which handles window creation and management,
as well as various input devices.

This month, glutin 0.27.0 was released, which makes glutin use the latest version
of winit (0.25.0), which was released around a month prior to glutin 0.27.0. Usually,
we try to keep glutin synced with winit, but we couldn't quite manage to do it this
time since the person who'd usually take responsibility for releasing a new version
of glutin was unavailable, and no-one had the role of "back-up releaser".
[@maroider] has offered to fill this role for now.

The upgrade to winit 0.25.0 brings with it a slew of bugfixes, a couple of new
features, and a single breaking change to
[WindowBuilderExtMacOS::with_activation_policy], which has been replaced by
[EventLoopExtMacOS::set_activation_policy]. For a full list of changes, refer
to [winit's changelog].

The departure and disappearance of a couple of maintainers has left winit in need
of someone knowledgeable with X11 in order to review pull requests and address
various issues. Other backends also need some more love, but X11 is the most
pressing.

The project could also use more helping hands in general, in anything from
mapping out platform differences and triaging bugs to reviewing PRs
and tackling outstanding issues.
The current maintainers would also be happy to have you even if
all you do is answer platform-specific questions for them.
If you're interested, come say hi in their [matrix] channel or on
any of the [other services] bridged with matrix.

### [erupt]

![erupt logo](erupt.svg)

[erupt] by [@Friz64] provides bindings to the Vulkan API.

Since being last mentioned in the newsletter shortly after its release, erupt
has undergone significant development. The generator, erupt's heart, has been
rewritten from scratch with the aim to improve maintainability. On top of that,
many bugs were fixed, the function loader was rewritten and usability was
improved while always keeping up to date with the latest Vulkan Headers as best
as possible.

The ecosystem has gained traction, with many people using the crate for their
projects. Pure Rust Vulkan allocators with support for erupt have been released.

### [smooth-bevy-cameras]

[smooth-bevy-cameras] by [@bonsairobo] is a small plugin for Bevy Engine that
makes it simple to have [exponentially smoothed] camera transforms in your game.
Just add a new bundle to your camera entity,
and rather than updating a `Transform` directly, you can just update the `eye`
and `target` values of a `LookTransform`, which will be automatically
synchronized to the `Transform`.

Several example controllers are provided as well:

- First Person
- Orbit
- Unreal Engine Viewport

### [wgpu] family re-union

![wgpu family reunion](wgpu-family-reunion.jpg)

[wgpu] is a [WebGPU] implementation in Rust. It is safe, efficient,
and portable: it can target both native and the Web.

[Family reunion] is by far the biggest change in wgpu project since
the inception. First, the Rust API of [wgpu-rs] was moved to the main
[wgpu] repository. Second, the whole base was relicensed under MIT/Apache2.

[gfx-hal] - the Vulkan Portability-like graphics API abstraction -
was detached from the project. Instead, wgpu got its own in-house unsafe
abstraction called "wgpu-hal" developed within the [wgpu] repository.

The team released [wgpu-0.9] right before this transition, to give the new
graphics infrastructure more time to take shape. At the time of writing,
supported backends on the new HAL include Vulkan, Metal, and OpenGL ES3.

Finally, the testing infrastructure received a major upgrade. It started
rendering the examples on the available adapters and comparing the results
with reference images.
This includes automatic testing using software adapters on CI.

### [rafx]

[![Rafx Flythrough Demo](rafx-flythrough-demo.jpg)][rafx-youtube-video]
_A scene exported via blender with animated camera motion, [watch the demo on youtube][rafx-youtube-video]!_

[Rafx][rafx] is a multi-backend renderer that optionally integrates with the
[distill][rafx-distill] asset pipeline.

This month, the asset pipeline received almost all the attention. A custom
blender add-on was prototyped, and several project layouts were tested to
decide on "best practices" to recommend for anyone that wants to use `rafx`
with 3d assets.

Using a custom add-on will enable a workflow that supports large scenes with
many assets. The add-on currently exports textures, materials, meshes, models
(a collection of meshes of varying LOD levels), and prefabs (a list of lights,
meshes, etc. to place in the world).

Some commercial art packs with varying art styles and complexity have been
ported to this pipeline, and one of them was loaded into the demo. A
fly-through camera was animated and exported out as json to demonstrate the
scene.

After prototyping is complete, details and lessons learned will be
shared in hopes that it will be helpful to other projects in the rust
community, even if they do not use rafx directly.

### [egui-tetra]

[egui-tetra] ([GitHub][egui-github]) by [@tesselode] is a library
that integrates [egui], an immediate mode GUI library,
with [Tetra], a 2D game framework.

egui-tetra provides helpers for integrating egui with Tetra's event loop and
rendering the GUI.

### [bevy_midi]

![bevy_midi logo](bevy_midi_logo.svg)

[bevy_midi] by [@BlackPhlox] is a new bevy plugin that uses
[midir] to interact with the bevy game engine.

It started out with [bevy_osc] as a
proof-of-concept interfacing with [nannou_osc]
and using other osc software to communicate with bevy.
Soon, realizing that nannou_osc is not that different
from how you interface with midi, bevy_midi was born.

Here is one of the examples which you can use a midi controller
to play piano with [demo_audio].

The plugin is still in its infancy.
So it still has some performance issues, so
any feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.

### [bevy_config_cam]

![bevy_config_cam logo](bevy_config_cam_logo.svg)

[bevy_config_cam] by [@BlackPhlox]
is an all-in-one purpose camera/player controller for bevy.

With focus on plug-and-play, flexibility and ease of use, this bevy plugin is
for anyone who is prototyping in 3D and doesn't want the hassle of programming
a player-controller from scratch. Instantly switch between camera modes such as
Tracking to Topdown, Follow Behind, FPS and Free and more.

The plugin is very new.
So any feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.

### [assets_manager]

[assets_manager] provides easy file loading and caching, with a focus on
hot-reloading.

In June was released version 0.5.0, which came with many new features.
`assets_manager` has now built-in support for loading sounds and images, and
Zip archive were added as a new source to load assets from. Additionally, the
API around directories was reworked to be more powerful, and performances were
improved a bit.
