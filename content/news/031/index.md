Welcome to the 31st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Name Needed][name-needed]

_The player orders a selection of blocks to be broken, and a brick wall to be
built._

[Name Needed][name-needed] by [@DomWilliams0][domwilliams-github] is a one-man
effort to produce an open source, intuitive and high performance Dwarf
Fortress-esque game with a custom engine.

Recent progress has been on procedural terrain generation, the player UI, item
stacks and build jobs. A major refactor of the AI system integrated Rust's
superb `async`/`await` support, which is documented in the most recent devlog.

### [This is Fine Sokoban][sokoban-github]

_Screenshot of This is Fine Sokoban_

This is Fine Sokoban ([GitHub][sokoban-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a Sokoban game inspired by the This is Fine
meme created for the [Game Developers Refuge 4x4x4 Challenge] in February
2022. Use the arrow keys to push the TPS reports into the file folders while
the room is burning down and you're surrounded by clocks - a metaphor for
the developer's work life.

The 4x4x4 Challenge was to create a game based on four emojis. In
this case the chosen emoji combination was: :nerd_face: :open_file_folder:
:clock830: :fire:

The game is part of an open source repository of several mini-games that use
Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].

### [Build A Better Buddy][build-a-better-buddy]

[![Build A Better Buddy Screenshot](build-a-better-buddy.png)][build-a-better-buddy]

Build A Better Buddy is a cute auto-battler built by [@cart_cart][cart-cart] using
[Bevy Engine][buddy-bevy-engine] for [Bevy Jam #1][buddy-bevy-jam-1]. The source
code is [available here][buddy-source]. It runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and
the Web.

### [Weegames]

![Grid of Weegames minigames](weegames.jpg)

[Weegames] is a fast-paced minigame collection available on web and Windows.
The latest release:

- Uses [quad-storage] on WASM to save high scores
  and a record of how games the player has played
- Fixes bug where the game was being played at an incorrect speed
  when the player's monitor was not 60hz
- Adds 8 more minigames

### [Vismut]

![Vismut](vismut.png)

[Vismut] ([GitLab][Vismut GitLab], [Zulip][Vismut Zulip]) by
[@lukors][Vismut @lukors]
will be a procedural texturing tool.

This application saw its first public release a month ago, where it added
support for its first use case: manual channel shuffling.

The latest version, [v0.4.0][Vismut v0.4.0], brings an all new interface that's
not only prettier, but also much easier to use thanks to `bevy_egui`!

Upcoming versions will turn it into a fully featured node based procedural
texturing tool. [Read the introduction][Vismut Introduction]
on the author's blog for more information.

## Library Updates

### [vach]

[vach] is an archiving file format developed from the ground up for games and
other realtime applications by [@zeskeertwee] and [@sokorototo]. It is
written in pure Rust.

Its primary objectives (in no particular order) are:

- Have a simple, yet complete API.
- Fine control over each individual entry in an archive, i.e. neighbouring
  entries can have vastly different compression schemes.
- Support compression (with multiple compression schemes), encryption,
  and signatures for data authentication
- Efficient fetching of data by avoiding unnecessary traversal of the file.
  Once a file is parsed, locations of every entry are known to the loader.
- Be as compact as possible - the smallest valid archive is only 13 bytes.
- Each entry has some metadata attached to it - this is implemented using
  bitflags and up to 8 bits are free to the user.
- Has mutlithreaded implementations of both the loader and the writer.

A [CLI][vach-cli] is allowing one to use vach as a general purpose archive
format. The CLI is fully multithreaded, allowing for insane un/packing speeds.

Feel free to drop into the [repo][vach] and open an issue, pull request or
drop a star ðŸŒŸ. It helps maintain momentum in the project.

### Sparsey 0.7

![Sparsey](sparsey.png)

[Sparsey] by [@LechintanTudor] is a sparse set-based Entity Component System
with beautiful and concise syntax.

The biggest change in this release was the removal of component change detection
which had a significant impact on performance and memory usage. As a result,
Sparsey performs much better in all benchmarks and the codebase is easier to
maintain.

The systems module received a major overhaul with an improved scheduling
algorithm, allowing more systems to run in parallel, and an important usability
improvement allowing systems to be added to schedules without having to call
`.system()` on the system functions.
