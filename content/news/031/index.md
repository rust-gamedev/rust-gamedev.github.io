Welcome to the 31st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[![A molecoole and some enemies](molecoole.png)][molecoole-steam]

Molecoole is a top-down shooter roguelike where you build your character from
different atoms. Each atom has a unique ability to provide tons of variety
between playthroughs. It's made using the [Bevy Engine][bevy-engine].

This month Molecoole launched on [Steam][molecoole-steam], making it the first
game made with Bevy Engine there! It's available on Windows and Linux. You can
check out its gameplay on [youtube][youtube-molecoole], or on the Steam page.
