Welcome to the 31st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Encase]

[Encase] ([docs.rs], [crates.io]) by [@teoxoy] is a new library
that provides a mechanism to lay out data into GPU buffers
according to [WGSL's memory layout] rules.

Features

- supports all WGSL [host-shareable types] + wrapper types
  (`&T`, `&mut T`, `Box<T>`, ...)
- extensible by design; most traits can be easily implemented
  for user defined types via macros (see [design])
- built in support for data types from a multitude of crates
  (enabled via [features])
- covers a wide area of use cases (see [examples])

Example

```rust
use encase::{WgslType, UniformBuffer};

#[derive(WgslType)]
struct AffineTransform2D {
    matrix: glam::Mat2,
    translate: glam::Vec2
}

let transform = AffineTransform2D {
    matrix: glam::Mat2::IDENTITY,
    translate: glam::Vec2::ZERO,
};

let mut buffer = UniformBuffer::new(Vec::new());
buffer.write(&transform).unwrap();
let byte_buffer = buffer.into_inner();

// write byte_buffer to GPU
```
