Welcome to the 31st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [This is Fine Sokoban][sokoban-github]

This is Fine Sokoban ([GitHub][sokoban-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a Sokoban game inspired by the The is Fine
meme created for the [Game Developers Refuge 4x4x4 Challenge] in February
2022. Use the arrow keys to push the TPS reports into the file folders while
the room is burning down and you're surrounded by clocks - a metaphor for
my work life.

The 4x4x4 Challenge was to create a game based on four emojis. In
this case the chosen emoji combination was: :nerd_face: :open_file_folder: :clock830: :fire: .

The game is part of an open source repository of several mini-games that use
Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].
