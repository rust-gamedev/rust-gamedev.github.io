Welcome to the 31st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [vach]

[vach] is an archiving file format developed from the ground up for games and other realtime applications by [@zeskeertwee] and [@sokorototo]. It is written in pure Rust.

It's primary objectives (in no perticular order) are:

- Have a simple, yet complete API.
- Fine control over each individual entry in an archive, ie neighbouring entries can have vastly different compression schemes.
- Support compression (with multiple compression schemes), enryption, signatures for data authentication
- Efficient fetching of data by avoiding unnecessary traversal of the file. Once a file is parsed locations of every entry are known to the loader.
- Be as compact as possible, the smallest valid archive is only 13 bytes.
- Each entry has some metadata attached to it, this is implemented using bitflags and up to 8 bits are free to the user.
- Has mutlithreaded implementations of both the loader and the writer.

A [cli][vach-cli] is allowing one to use vach as a general purpose archive format. The CLI is fully multithreaded, allowing for insane un/packing speeds. 

Feel free to drop into the [repo][vach] and open an issue, pull request or drop a star 🌟. It helps maintain momentum in the project.
