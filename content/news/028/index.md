Welcome to the 28th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Country Slice

![country-slice-gif](country_slice_gif.gif)

[Country Slice][country-slice-github] is [@anastasiaopara][country-slice-twitter]'s hobby project,
where users can draw a small scene, and their input is amplified with real-time procedural geometry generation.

Country Slice uses [Bevy Engine][bevy-link] for entity management, and has recently 
[been ported to OpenGL][country-slice-twitter-opengl] (using [gl-rs][gl-rs-link] and [glutin][glutin-link]). 
It is being developed openly on [GitHub][country-slice-github]. 

You can follow the development of Country Slice on [Twitter][country-slice-twitter].
