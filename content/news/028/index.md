Welcome to the 28th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[![Gameplay screenshot with lots of zombies in a tunnel](bitgun-zombies.jpeg)][bitgun-steam]

BITGUN ([Steam][bitgun-steam], [Twitter][bitgun-twitter],
[Discord][bitgun-discord]) by [@LogLogGames][bitgun-twitter] is an action
roguelike zombie shooter with lots of blood. The game is built using Godot
and Rust (via [godot-rust][bitgun-godot-rust]).

They recently implemented a mission system, where you can select one of
[three types of missions][bitgun-missions] to go to from the central camp.
One is to defend supplies from horde of zombies, second is to search
a facility for some object or clear all the zombies and the last one
is to fight your way through a tunnel full of spiders and other enemies!
They also worked on a [tutorial][bitgun-tutorial].

### Country Slice

![country-slice-gif](country_slice_gif.gif)

[Country Slice][country-slice-github] is
[@anastasiaopara][country-slice-twitter]'s hobby project, where users can draw a
small scene, and their input is amplified with real-time procedural geometry
generation.

Country Slice uses [Bevy Engine][bevy-link] for entity management, and has
recently [been ported to OpenGL][country-slice-twitter-opengl] (using
[gl-rs][gl-rs-link] and [glutin][glutin-link]). It is being developed openly on
[GitHub][country-slice-github].

You can follow the development of Country Slice on
[Twitter][country-slice-twitter].

## Learning Material Updates

### [The Raytracer Challenge][raytracer-challenge-github]

![The Raytracer Challenge](the-raytracer-challenge.jpg)

[The Raytracer Challenge][raytracer-challenge-github] is a project with the goal
to write a raytracer from scratch in Rust, while showing each step of the way
[as a weekly live coding session][raytracer-challenge-playlist]. Everything is
documented, starting with implementing [Vectors][raytracer-challenge-vector] and
[Matrices][raytracer-challenge-matrix] all the way to creating [Phong
Lighting][raytracer-challenge-phong].

November has been a busy month for the project with lots of visual changes in the
raytraced results:

- A [camera][raytracer-challenge-camera] was added to allow arbitrary views on
  the [World][raytracer-challenge-world].

- [Basic animation support][raytracer-challenge-animation] came along allowing
  the easy creation of video sequences.

- More realistic and life-like scenes due to [Shadow
  Casting][raytracer-challenge-shadows].

- As a new basic body type [Planes][raytracer-challenge-planes] came to life.

### [Pixels] 0.8.0 ðŸ‘¾

[Pixels] is a tiny hardware-accelerated pixel framebuffer. Its goals include
pixel-perfect rendering and custom shader pipelines for textures with direct
pixel access. It's perfect for making 2D animations, games, and emulators.

Version 0.8.0 was released this month, bringing highly anticipated support for
WASM targets, as well as support for Raspberry Pi 4. A [minimal example for web
browsers][pixels-web] is included to get you started. Full details are available
in the [release notes][pixels-changelog].
