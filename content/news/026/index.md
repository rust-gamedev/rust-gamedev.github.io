Welcome to the 26th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Weegames][weegames-itch]

![Handful of minigames including hedgehogs and raspberries](weegames.jpg)

[Weegames][weegames-itch] is a fast-paced minigame collection.
The Windows version of the game has been rewritten to use Macroquad,
so now the web and downloadable versions of the game share the same codebase.
Development for the web version has moved to the
[Weegames Github][weegames-github] repository.
