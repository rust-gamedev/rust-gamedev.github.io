Welcome to the 43rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [godot-rust][gd-github]

![godot-rust GDExtension](godot-rust-gdextension.png)

The [release of Godot version 4.0][gd-godot4] marks a significant milestone in
the game development ecosystem. godot-rust aims to bring the open-source
game engine to the Rust community.

For the [Godot 4 (GDExtension) binding][gd-gdextension], February was a very
productive month, with a handful of new contributors and [16 merged pull
requests][gd-pulse]. An up-to-date feature overview is available
[in issue #24][gd-24]. Last month's changes include:

- Support for arrays, packed arrays and dictionaries
- Support for some geometric types (vectors, quaternions, colors)
- Bugfixes regarding ref-counts, use-after-free, memory leaks

On the [Godot 3 (GDNative) side][gd-gdnative], lots of quality-of-life
improvements have found their way into the library:

- Class self-registration based on `inventory` crate
- Flexible self types: `fn instance(#[self] this: Instance<Self>)`
- Trait entry point: `#[callbacks] impl GDNativeCallbacks for MyLibrary {...}`

Both bullet lists are examples for how the GDNative and GDExtension bindings
mutually benefit each other, reusing proven designs for user-friendly Rust APIs.

### [Blue Engine][be-github]

![blue_engine logo](BlueEngineLogoSmall.png)
_Blue Engine Logo_

[Blue Engine][be-github] by [@ElhamAryanpur] is an easy to use, extendable, and
portable graphics engine built to make it easier to render 2D or 3D graphics.

This marks the first entry of Blue Engine in the newsletter. And there will be
more entries for the engine from now on, to get latest updates about the engine.

Although the month of febuary was slow for the development of the engine, there
have been significant efforts towards addition of [documentation][be-docs] and the
eventual release of the next version. In the meantime, the plugins have favored significant
updates and development in the month, notably the [egui][be-egui] plugin.

![blue_engine egui-plugin](blue_engine_egui_plugin_update.png)

Now the [egui plugin][be-egui] allow you to render objects of the engine direction
inside an egui window. This feature was built in collaboration with [@Noswad].

This also introduced a new option in Objects: `is_visible: bool`
which hides an object
from getting rendered if set to false (set to `true` as default). This allows
you to hide an object from getting rendered on the background of egui, and can then
add it to be rendered inside an egui window instead. So far the system on the second
design, suggestions are welcome to cement a better design. Refer to [example][be-egui-example].

## Learning Material Updates

### [Write a First Person Game in 2KB with Rust][firstperson-wasm4]

![Game Preview](firstperson.png)

[@grantshandy] published an [article][firstperson-wasm4] about creating a simple
first-person game in Rust with [WASM-4]. It covers the basics of a ray casting
algorithm and minifying Rust with WebAssembly. You can play the finished game
[here][firstperson-wasm4-game].

## Tooling Updates

### Sprite and Pixel Art Editor

![Image editor screenshot](sprite_pixel_art_editor.png)
_Screenshot of the editor_

A sprite and pixel art editor made with egui and macroquad is being
developed by @yds12 ([github][yds-github], [mastodon][yds-mastodon]).
The project is already usable, but has not been made public yet. Current
features are

- Drawing w/ brush, eraser, lines, rectangles, bucket (fill w/ color)
- Color selector, editable palette and eyedropper (pick color from canvas)
- Resize or completely erase the canvas
- Move camera, zoom in and out
- Selection (rectangular only for now), deleted, copied and pasted; flip
  selection (horizontal or vertical)
- Layers: create, remove, moved up/down, control visibility and opacity
- Spritesheet: specify how many columns and rows your image has, and an
  animated preview will be displayed in a window w/ configurable scale
- Save/load projects (with all its settings), export and import PNG/JPG
- Status bar w/ info about canvas size, canvas position, color under mouse, etc

The source is planned to be released in the next few weeks
