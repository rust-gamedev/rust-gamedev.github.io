Welcome to the 51st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Announcements

### Survey Results

Last month, we asked you to fill out a survey to help us improve the rebooted newsletter. Thanks to 52 of you, we've got [some data][survey-data] now! 
We analyzed the results in [this blog post][survey_results]. The biggest takeaways are:
- People are generally excited about the newsletter
- The current frequency of the newsletter is good
- Readers do not want anything in the newsletter generated by AI
- Contributing to the newsletter could be easier. If you've got ideas on how to make this happen, please [let us know](https://github.com/rust-gamedev/rust-gamedev.github.io/issues/1519)!

You can visit the [blog post][survey_results] to see the full results and some nice plots. 
We will discuss how to act on this feedback next month and keep you updated on the changes we make. 

Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Email Subscription

Last month, we announced that we would add an email subscription option to the newsletter. 
Unfortunately, we did not manage to implement this in time for this issue.
He will [work on this feature](https://github.com/rust-gamedev/rust-gamedev.github.io/issues/24) for the next month, and we hope to have it ready for you then.

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea][wor]

[![Way of Rhea](wor.jpg)][wor]
*Way of Rhea: a puzzle game. Available on Steam.*

[Way of Rhea][wor] released on May 20th as part of the
[Cerebral Puzzle Showcase][wor-cps]!

[![Way of Rhea](wor-animated.gif)][wor]

Way of Rhea is a color-based puzzle game with difficult puzzles, but
forgiving mechanics developed by [Mason Remaley] in a custom Rust engine.

You can support development by [purchasing Way of Rhea on Steam][wor], or
[signing up for the mailing list][wor-mail] to hear about future games.

### [Untitled Pixel Wizard Game][pixel-wizards]

[![A target being destroyed by a rudimentary flame thrower spell](untitled-pixel-wizards-game.gif)][pixel-wizards]  
_A deadly foe meets its end._

[Untitled Pixel Wizard Game][pixel-wizards] is a local-multiplayer [Noita]-like platformer about
killing baddies using spells powered by pixel physics.

Over the last few months, the falling sand simulation learned to play (somewhat) nicely with Rapier
rigid bodies; see [Bridging Physics Worlds][pixel-wizards-bridging-physics-worlds] and subsequent updates.

This month:

- [Tilemapping via LDTK][pixel-wizards-tilemapping]: levels got just a tiny bit prettier.
- [Level Progression][pixel-wizards-levels]: players learn to die, and levels link together.
- [Target Practice][pixel-wizards-targets]: the first "enemy" was added to the game.

### [mirr/orb]

![mirr/orb](mirrorb.png)  
_A typical level and its UI_

[mirr/orb] by [syn9]
is a puzzle game about bouncing lasers off mirrors to activate orbs.

The game was created in 9 days using syn9's Rust mini game framework [mgfw] and released on May 27th.

This release contains 110 levels which pull from 870 available puzzle layouts.

### [CyberGate Playground][cybergate-shorts]

![Improved Hammer Destruction](cybergate.gif)  
_Shooting a Hammer against a Floating Wall and Destroying part of it_

CyberGate Playground is a multiplayer browser game where players claim territory
by painting the environment in their color, with the goal of overpowering opponents.

The past few months' updates include:
- Flying with butterfly-like mechanics
- [Fusion Upgrade:][cybergate-fuse] Combine hammers, balls, and dice to multiply their powers
- Hammer destruction made more challenging and interesting, with upgrades enabling deeper wall penetration
- Improved strength and weight system, and calculate their impact on character movement and abilities
- Added an 'Owned Upgrades' menu using `yakui` crate, giving a neat overview of all acquired upgrades
- Many other UI / gameplay improvements based on player feedback

Rust's ownership and strongly typed features played a crucial role in allowing the gameplay code to scale 
to more complex and detailed mechanics while retaining correct, clean, and bug-free code.

CyberGate Playground is a passion project.

### Bevy 0.14 WIP

![Bevy repeated textures](bevy_rep.jpg)

_The Playdate console_

[Rusty Playdate] ([GitHub][Rusty Playdate], [Mastodon][Rusty Playdate Masto]) by [@boozook](https://github.com/boozook)
is the large set of crates with bindings, cargo-plugin, and toolset for the full cycle of creating games for the [Playdate handheld console][playdate].

The current release sports the following notable improvements:
- Partial Lua scripting support
- Support for devices connected to macOS via USB hub
- Stabilize packaging on Windows enough to add automatic tests
- Stabilization for various parts of the API
