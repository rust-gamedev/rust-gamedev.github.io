Welcome to the 51th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Way of Rhea][wor]

[![Way of Rhea](wor.jpg)][wor]
*Way of Rhea: a puzzle game. Available on Steam.*

[Way of Rhea][wor] released on May 20th as part of the
[Cerebral Puzzle Showcase][wor-cps]!

[![Way of Rhea](wor-animated.gif)][wor]

Way of Rhea is a color-based puzzle game with difficult puzzles, but
forgiving mechanics developed by [Mason Remaley] in a custom Rust engine.

You can support development by [purchasing Way of Rhea on Steam][wor], or
[signing up for the mailing list][wor-mail] to hear about future games.

### [Untitled Pixel Wizard Game][pixel-wizards]

[![A target being destroyed by a rudimentary flame thrower spell](untitled-pixel-wizards-game.gif)][pixel-wizards]
_A deadly foe meets their end._

[Untitled Pixel Wizard Game][pixel-wizards] is a local-multiplayer [Noita]-like platformer about
killing baddies using spells powered by pixel physics.

Over the last few months, the falling sand simulation learned to play (somewhat) nicely with Rapier
rigid bodies; see [Bridging Physics Worlds][pixel-wizards-bridging-physics-worlds] and subsequent updates.

This month:

- [Tilemapping via LDTK][pixel-wizards-tilemapping]: levels got just a tiny bit prettier.
- [Level Progression][pixel-wizards-levels]: players learned to die, and levels link together.
- [Architectural Ruminations][pixel-wizards-arch]: reflections on using Rust for game development,
  prompted by LogLog Games's '[Leaving Rust gamedev after 3 years]'.
- [Target Practice][pixel-wizards-targets]: the first "enemy" was added to the game.

### [mirr/orb]

![mirr/orb](mirrorb.png)

[mirr/orb] by [syn9]
is a puzzle game about bouncing lasers off mirrors to activate orbs.

The game was created in 9 days using syn9's Rust mini game framework (mgfw) and released on May 27th.

This release contains 110 levels which pull from 870 available puzzle layouts.

### [CyberGate Playground][cybergate-shorts]

![Improved Hammer Destruction](cybergate.mp4)
_Shooting a Hammer against a Floating Wall and Destroying part of it_

CyberGate Playground is a multiplayer browser game where players claim territory
by painting the environment in their color, with the goal of overpowering opponents.

The past few months' updates include:
- Flying with butterfly-like mechanics;
- [Fusion Upgrade:][cybergate-fuse] Combine hammers, balls, dices, to multiply their powers;
- Hammer destruction made more challenging and interesting, with upgrades enabling deeper wall penetration;
- Improved Strength and Weight system, and calculate their impact on character movement and abilities;
- Added an 'Owned Upgrades' menu using `yakui` crate, giving a neat overview of all acquired upgrades;
- Many other UI / gameplay improvements based on player feedback;

Rust's ownership and strongly typed features played a crucial role in allowing the gameplay code to scale 
to more complex and detailed mechanics while retaining correct, clean, and bug-free code.

CyberGate Playground is a passion project.
