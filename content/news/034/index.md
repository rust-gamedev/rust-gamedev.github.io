Welcome to the 34th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Flying down a mountain](veloren.jpg)
_A glorious flight to distant lands_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In May, work was done on Wyvern models. Smoke was improved from houses, and now
has different colours and strenghts. A rib cage generator was added, so now
there are large bone structures from ancient times around the world. Level of
detail objects were added, so trees can now be seen on far off mountains. This
makes the world feel significantly more alive. A lot of work was done on the
performance of the game server, as Veloren has been seeing over 100 concurrent
players at peak on the server nearly every day for the past few weeks.

Lots of work was done on balancing items and drop rates. Water caves have been
worked on, which now means that you might need to enter them from underwater.
Modular weapons were merged, which was a change several months in the making.
NPCs are now able to pick up items that are on the ground. Work was done on
taming and mounting various animals. Weather is still in the works, with
improvements to the ambiant SFX system for rain. A new UI concept was created
for what Airshipper might be able to look like in the future.

## Engine Updates

## Learning Material Updates

### [Intro to Material/Shaders in Bevy][bevy-materials-playlist]

![Bevy Materials video series thumbnail](bevy-material-series.png)

[Matthew Bryant][matthew-bryant-youtube] has created
[a series about Bevy's Material abstraction][bevy-materials-playlist],
showing how to use custom WGSL shaders in Bevy.

The series walks through the documention to understand why steps are done in
order to build a clear theoretical understanding of Bevy's high level abstractions.

- The first of the three videos covers the bare minimum needed
  to render a material;
- the second introduces bind groups to use textures and generic data in
  the shader;
- and the final video ties into Bevy's ECS to copy game data onto the
  graphics card every frame.

He will be releasing videos about UI in Bevy and Rapier physics next month.

### [Kubecon 2022, Lightning Talk: Wasmcloud + Bevy ECS][Lightning-Talk-schedule]

![A picture of speakers](./lightingtalk.jpeg)

[QQparty][alanpoon-qqparty] is a serverless multiplayer game built with Bevy ECS
and [Wasmcloud][wasmcloud_website].

This month, [@rustropy_gaming][alanpoon_twitter] joined Cosmonic to give
a series of Wasmcloud talks in Kubecon 2022 VLC. They demonstrated
how Bevy can be added into Wasmcloud's actors as a serverless
game server.

You can check out a recording of the talk on [YouTube][Lightning-Talk-youtube],
as well as viewing the [slides][Lightning-Talk-pdf]. For updates on QQparty,

### [Rusteroids][rusteroids-youtube-playlist]

![A screenshot of the latest Rusteroids tutorial](./rusteroids-screenshot.png)

[Rusteroids][rusteroids-github] is a tutorial recreating a clone of Asteroids
in Rust, using SDL2 and the [Specs][rust-specs-crate] library.

New episodes are released weekly and added to the playlist. Most recently,
collision detection was added to reset the game state when the asteroid
and player collide. The latest episode is [here][rusteroids-latest].

## Tooling Updates

### [Bloom3D][bloom3d]

[![A screenshot of Bloom3D's interface. A geometric tree is next to a building.](bloom.jpg)][bloom3d]

[Bloom3D](bloom3d) is a minimalist web app for 3D modeling that's built in Rust.

This month [@kettlecorn][kettlecorn_twitter] released a new version of
[Bloom3D][bloom3d] that adds a variety of new features including a
rectangle tool, move tool, and OBJ export.

Check out the [Twitter announcement thread][bloom_update_twitter] for an overview
and videos of all the new features.

Bloom is powered by a custom game engine called [`koi`](koi) that is open-sourced
on GitHub.

## Library Updates

### [bevy_mod_scripting]

![bevy_mod_scripting logo](logo_bevy_scripting.svg)

[bevy_mod_scripting] by @makspll is a brand new Bevy plugin
enabling multi-language scripting (currently in Lua and Rhai).

The plugin is in early stages but as of now supports:

- Handling events at multiple points of your stage pipeleine.
- Sending events to specific, or all scripts.
- Setting event priority to order your callbacks.
- Defining custom state and API's at initialization.
- Sending run-time error events (to for example show them in an in-game console).
- One-shot scripts.

General Bevy API support is under-way so stay tuned!
