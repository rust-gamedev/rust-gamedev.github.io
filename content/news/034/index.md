([Steam][hgs_steam], [Facebook][hgs_facebook], [Discord][hgs_discord])
is a realistic sailing/foiling inshore simulator in development for PC/Steam
that will put you in the driving seat of modern competitive sailing.
Hydrofoil Generation is based on a custom made DirectX 11 based engine.

A new [trailer][hgs_trailer] just landed showcasing new animations, the new
Hong Kong location, and camera modes.

Meanwhile, private beta-testing is well underway with good feedback regarding
boat controls and physics, netcode, and software stability, Rust for sure
delivered on all the promises here.

The first set of Sailing rules has also been implemented and part of the
current beta testing process with more rules to be added in the next months.

Sadly the target Q2 2022 Early Access release on Steam couldn't be hit and
now the team is aiming at a Q4 2022 release.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Flying down a mountain](veloren.jpg)
_A glorious flight to distant lands_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In May, work was done on Wyvern models. Smoke was improved from houses, and now
has different colours and strengths. A rib cage generator was added, so now
there are large bone structures from ancient times around the world. Level of
detail objects were added, so trees can now be seen on far-off mountains. This
makes the world feel significantly more alive. A lot of work was done on the
performance of the game server, as Veloren has been seeing over 100 concurrent
players at peak on the server nearly every day for the past few weeks.

Lots of work was done on balancing items and drop rates. Water caves have been
worked on, which now means that you might need to enter them from underwater.
Modular weapons were merged, which was a change several months in the making.
NPCs are now able to pick up items that are on the ground. Work was done on
taming and mounting various animals. Weather is still in the works, with
improvements to the ambient SFX system for rain. A new UI concept was created
for what Airshipper might be able to look like in the future.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Intro to Material/Shaders in Bevy][bevy-materials-playlist]

![Bevy Materials video series thumbnail](bevy-material-series.png)

[Matthew Bryant][matthew-bryant-youtube] has created
[a series about Bevy's Material abstraction][bevy-materials-playlist],
showing how to use custom WGSL shaders in Bevy.

The series walks through the documentation to understand why steps are done in
order to build a clear theoretical understanding of Bevy's high-level abstractions.

- The first of the three videos covers the bare minimum needed
  to render a material;
- the second introduces bind groups to use textures and generic data in
  the shader;
- and the final video ties into Bevy's ECS to copy game data onto the
  graphics card every frame.

He will be releasing videos about UI in Bevy and Rapier physics next month.

### [Audio Libraries Considered Challenging][audio-hard-article]

[@tesselode] shared [an article][audio-hard-article] about
the difficulties of making audio libraries:

> I develop a game audio library called [Kira].
> Here's some of the hard parts I've figured out.
> If you decide to make an audio library for some reason,
> learn from my experimentation!
> <...>
> Making audio libraries is hard. I don't know the best way to do it.
> This is just what I've tried and how it went for me.

[Bloom3D](bloom3d) is a minimalist web app for 3D modeling that's built in Rust.

Bloom is powered by a custom game engine called [`koi`](koi) that is open-sourced
on GitHub.

This month [@kettlecorn][kettlecorn_twitter] released a new version of
[Bloom3D][bloom3d] that adds a variety of new features including a
rectangle tool, move tool, and OBJ export.
Check out the [Twitter announcement thread][bloom_update_twitter] for an overview
and videos of all the new features.

### [Graphite][graphite-website]

![Graphite](graphite.png)

Graphite ([website][graphite-website], [GitHub][graphite-repo],
[Discord][graphite-discord], [Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is a free,
in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor. It will be powered by a
node graph compositing engine that supercharges your layer stack, providing a
completely non-destructive editing experience.

- Spring cleaning: The past month's Sprint 15 work has focused mostly on
  technical debt cleanup, documentation, and bug fixes around the frontend. That
  continues with the Rust backend next month.

- A radiant gradient: The Gradient tool now supports radial styles in
  addition to linear.

- New blog post: [Learn about the plans][graphite-blog-post] for
  distributed computing across many CPUs and GPUs with Graphene, the Rust-based
  node graph engine and renderer that will power Graphite.

Open the [Graphite editor][graphite-live-demo] in your browser to give it a try
and share your creations with #MadeWithGraphite on Twitter.

## Library Updates

### [bevy_mod_scripting]

![bevy_mod_scripting logo](logo_bevy_scripting.svg)

[bevy_mod_scripting] by @makspll is a brand new Bevy plugin
enabling multi-language scripting (currently in Lua and Rhai).

The plugin is in early stages but as of now supports:

- Handling events at multiple points of your stage pipeline.
- Sending events to specific, or all scripts.
- Setting event priority to order your callbacks.
- Defining custom state and APIs at initialization.
- Sending run-time error events (to for example show them in an in-game console).
- One-shot scripts.

General Bevy API support is under-way so stay tuned!

### [bevy_silk]

![bevy_silk logo](bevy_silk.png)

[bevy_silk] by @[ManevilleF] is a cloth physics plugin for Bevy.

Apply cloth physics to any mesh, by adding a single component to your entity!

Features:

- Collision support using [bevy_rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier)
- Global and per-entity physics customization
- Dynamic smooth and flat normals
- Wind forces
- Custom cloth anchors

The library is fully documented and the repository provides various usage examples.

### [bevy_asset_loader]

[bevy_asset_loader] by [@nikl_me] is a Bevy plugin that helps with asset
loading and asset organisation. It greatly reduces boilerplate code for
loading states and can resolve asset configuration at run time.

This month, version `0.11.0` was released. It supports loading lists of files
as `Vec<HandleUntyped>` or `Vec<Handle<T>>`. This is an alternative to loading
folders, which is not supported on the web. You can now track the loading
progress of your assets with [iyes_progress] and build loading bars.
Integrating with [iyes_loopless] gives you some benefits of stageless
scheduling in current Bevy. Additionally, the loading of assets fields
without attributes was improved. It now uses the `FromWorld` trait
instead of `Default`.

More improvements will likely follow for the dynamic asset story. One goal
is to allow loading any custom values as dynamic assets.

### [bevy_kira_audio]

[bevy_kira_audio] by [@nikl_me] is an alternative audio
plugin for Bevy. It uses [Kira] to play and control
game audio.

This month saw the release of version `0.10.0`. The plugin
now uses the latest Kira release, which was a major rewrite.
The audio channel API is improved by making all channels
resources in Bevy's ECS and sounds can be directly loaded
from asset files with settings like their volume, playback
rate, or panning. Additionally, the audio backend can now
be configured before creation through a settings resource.

### [Sparsey]

[Sparsey] by [@LechintanTudor] is a sparse set-based Entity Component System
with beautiful and concise syntax.

The latest release, 0.8.0, adds some convenience panicking functions for
borrowing resources and a method for resetting a `World` to its default state
without having to recreate it.

### [Notan v0.4][Notan]

[Notan] is a simple and portable layer designed to create your own multimedia
apps on top of it without worrying about platform-specific code.

The main goal is to provide a set of APIs and tools that can be used to create
your project in an ergonomic manner without enforcing any structure or pattern,
always trying to stay out of your way. The idea is that you can use it as a
foundation layer or backend for your next app, game engine, or game.

The latest version [v0.4] adds [touch support] and fixes some minor bugs.

[Notan]: https://github.com/Nazariglez/notan
[touch support]: https://nazariglez.github.io/notan-web/examples/input_touches.html
[v0.4]: https://github.com/Nazariglez/notan/releases/tag/v0.4.0

### [carrier-pigeon]

[carrier-pigeon] by [@MitchellMarinoDev] is a rusty networking library for games.
It builds on the standard library's TcpStream and UdpSocket types
and handles all the serialization, sending, receiving, and deserialization.
This way you can worry about what to send,
and pigeon will worry about how to send it.
This also allows you to send and receive different types of messages independently.

[bevy-pigeon] is a Bevy plugin for carrier-pigeon.

[bong][pigeon-bong] is a combination of breakout and pong
that showcases bevy-pigeon and carrier-pigeon.
