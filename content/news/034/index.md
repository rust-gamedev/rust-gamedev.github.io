Welcome to the 34th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Hydrofoil Generation]

![hgs_screen](hgs34.jpg)

[Hydrofoil Generation]
([Steam][hgs_steam], [Facebook][hgs_facebook], [Discord][hgs_discord])
is a realistic sailing/foiling inshore simulator in development for PC/Steam
that will put you in the driving seat of modern competitive sailing.
Hydrofoil Generation is based on a custom made DirectX 11 based engine.

A new [trailer][hgs_trailer] just landed showcasing new animations, the new
Hong Kong location and camera modes.

Meanwhile, private beta-testing is well underway with good feedback regarding
boat controls and physics, netcode and software stability, Rust for sure
delivered on all the promises here.

The first set of Sailing rules has also been implemented and part of the
current beta testing process with more rules to be added in the next months.

Sadly we couldn't hit the target for a Q2 2022 Early Access release on Steam
and now aiming at a Q4 2022, wishlist Hydrofoil Generation now to make sure
you won't miss the release date!

## Engine Updates

## Learning Material Updates

### [Intro to Material/Shaders in Bevy][bevy-materials-playlist]

![Bevy Materials video series thumbnail](bevy-material-series.png)

[Matthew Bryant][matthew-bryant-youtube] has created
[a series about Bevy's Material abstraction][bevy-materials-playlist],
showing how to use custom WGSL shaders in Bevy.

The series walks through the documention to understand why steps are done in
order to build a clear theoretical understanding of Bevy's high level abstractions.

- The first of the three videos covers the bare minimum needed
  to render a material;
- the second introduces bind groups to use textures and generic data in
  the shader;
- and the final video ties into Bevy's ECS to copy game data onto the
  graphics card every frame.

He will be releasing videos about UI in Bevy and Rapier physics next month.

### [Kubecon 2022, Lightning Talk: Wasmcloud + Bevy ECS][Lightning-Talk-schedule]

![A picture of speakers](./lightingtalk.jpeg)

[QQparty][alanpoon-qqparty] is a serverless multiplayer game built with Bevy ECS
and [Wasmcloud][wasmcloud_website].

This month, [@rustropy_gaming][alanpoon_twitter] joined Cosmonic to give
a series of Wasmcloud talks in Kubecon 2022 VLC. They demonstrated
how Bevy can be added into Wasmcloud's actors as a serverless
game server.

You can check out a recording of the talk on [YouTube][Lightning-Talk-youtube],
as well as viewing the [slides][Lightning-Talk-pdf]. For updates on QQparty,

## Tooling Updates

### [Bloom3D][bloom3d]

[![A screenshot of Bloom3D's interface. A geometric tree is next to a building.](bloom.jpg)][bloom3d]

[Bloom3D](bloom3d) is a minimalist web app for 3D modeling that's built in Rust.

This month [@kettlecorn][kettlecorn_twitter] released a new version of
[Bloom3D][bloom3d] that adds a variety of new features including a
rectangle tool, move tool, and OBJ export.

Check out the [Twitter announcement thread][bloom_update_twitter] for an overview
and videos of all the new features.

Bloom is powered by a custom game engine called [`koi`](koi) that is open-sourced
on GitHub.

## Library Updates

### [bevy_mod_scripting]

![bevy_mod_scripting logo](logo_bevy_scripting.svg)

[bevy_mod_scripting] by @makspll is a brand new Bevy plugin
enabling multi-language scripting (currently in Lua and Rhai).

The plugin is in early stages but as of now supports:

- Handling events at multiple points of your stage pipeleine.
- Sending events to specific, or all scripts.
- Setting event priority to order your callbacks.
- Defining custom state and API's at initialization.
- Sending run-time error events (to for example show them in an in-game console).
- One-shot scripts.

General Bevy API support is under-way so stay tuned!
