Welcome to the 34th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

[Bloom3D](bloom3d) is a minimalist web app for 3D modeling that's built in Rust.

This month [@kettlecorn][kettlecorn_twitter] released a new version of
[Bloom3D][bloom3d] that adds a variety of new features including a
rectangle tool, move tool, and OBJ export.

Check out the [Twitter announcement thread][bloom_update_twitter] for an overview
and videos of all the new features.

Bloom is powered by a custom game engine called [`koi`](koi) that is open-sourced
on GitHub.
