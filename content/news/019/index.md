### [SeniorSKY]

![SeniorSKY](senior_sky.png)
_Rising sun_

[SeniorSKY] is a flight simulator that uses the Vulkan API, developed by
[@pmathia0]. As an aerospace engineering student, Peter has always been
interested in how a flight simulator works under the hood. The development of
SeniorSKY started as a hobby project during university studies.

SeniorSKY uses real-world elevation data with 1 arc second precision and can
render the whole globe in real dimensions. During the flight, the terrain tiles
are loaded dynamically based on real GPS coordinates of airplane, with a
decreasing level of detail further from the camera. This is achieved using a
combination of a terrain-quad-tree and GPU tessellation.

Notable changes since last month:

- Atmospheric scattering
- Improved fog
- FXAA + HDR tone mapping
- Terrain data preprocessing using compute shaders
- Performance optimizations

Short-term plans:

- replace imgui-rs by egui
- implement sun position based on datetime
- add terrain bump-maps to visualize gravel

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Lush forest](veloren.jpg)
_A lush forest to explore_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In February, lots of work has been done on worldsim, with travelling merchants
being worked on. Some experiments have been happening on procedurally generating
giant trees. Lots is being done on the combat end, with dual wielding and
modular weapons being a big focus. Player trading was also implemented, which
allows items to be shared on the server. A large internal shift is being made
from diesel to rusqlite.

A rework of attacks was done to allow their effects to be more dynamic. Lots of
work has been done on the art team, with new weapon models, new mobs like fish.
Some quality of life improvements were added, like humanoids automatically
deploying gliders while falling to avoid fall damage. CI changes were made to
finally have the Github mirror update periodically without error from LFS
storage. In March, Veloren will release 0.9.

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [Rafx][rafx-github]

![Screenshot from Rafx Rendering Framework](rafx-screenshot.png)

Rafx is a multi-backend renderer that optionally integrates with the
[distill][rafx-distill] asset pipeline. Rafx is divided into three tiers of
functionality:

`rafx-api` provides a custom GPU API abstraction layer that currently supports
Vulkan and metal. ([API in rust psuedocode][rafx-api-design])

`rafx-framework` builds on the API layer using ideas found in modern shipping
AAA titles. Rendering is pipelined in a separate thread in three phases, using
jobs to extract data from the main thread, process the data on the render
thread, and write the draw calls to command buffers. [[Tatarchuk
2015][rafx-gdc-2015]] A render graph ensures correct synchronization.
[[O'Donnell 2017][rafx-gdc-2017]] The framework also provides a material
abstraction and shader pipeline.

`rafx-assets` adds integration with the [distill][rafx-distill] asset pipeline.
This ensures that when an asset like a mesh is loaded, other related assets like
textures/material/vertex data are loaded. By integrating with Distill, rafx
provides advanced features like streaming live asset updates to remote devices.

### [Graphite][graphite-repo]

![Graphite GUI](graphite.png)
_Progress on the GUI_

[Graphite][graphite-repo] ([GitHub][graphite-repo], [Discord][graphite-discord],
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/GraphiteEditor)) is an in-progress vector and
raster graphics editor built on a nondestructive node-based workflow.

Since February's Rust Gamedev Meetup [which announced][graphite-video] the
Graphite vision has attracted tremendous interest, community advice has shifted
the development strategy to focus on a 0.1 MVP release ASAP:

- The past year's in-development custom GUI has been shelved in lieu of an
  interim web GUI. Graphite intends to natively support Windows, Mac, Linux, and
  Web. This change unblocks core application development but means Graphite is
  Web-only until the Rust GUI ecosystem matures. Good progress this month has
  been made building the web GUI with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
- Graphite 0.1 will now support only vector editing. This defers the large
  complexity of the graph render engine required for node-based raster editing.
  It should be less difficult to first focus on building a vector editor that
  improves upon the UX of Illustrator and Inkscape.

### [wgpu-rs]

wgpu-rs is a WebGPU implementation and API in Rust.

- "wgpu-core"-0.7.1 was published with fixes
- API updated for blending states, cull faces, vertex formats
- Zero-initialization of buffers upon use
- Validation of texture bindings, index formats for strip topologies
- Binding tracker was rewritten with test-ability in mind, bugs fixed
- The player learned to resize the window properly. API traces can now be
  replayed on Linux even when swapchain recreation events are present
- SPIRV-Cross was made optional, which was useful for Deno in order to work
  around the linking conflict with "rusty_v8"

[wgpu-rs]: https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs

### [gfx-rs]

gfx-rs is a portable low-level graphics abstraction layer.

- API got `PhysicalDeviceProperties` containing limits and properties of
  physical devices that are not opt-in.
- SPIRV-Cross dependency was made optional, while Naga is required.
- Vulkan backend learned to target Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 internally.
- DX12 understood more limits.
- GL backend fixed WebGL initialization and EGL library discovery.

[gfx-rs]: https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx

### [naga]

naga is the shader translation library/tool.

- Versions 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 were published with fixes
- API: function calls turned into statements, image queries , and stores,
  understanding of push constants.
- Validation: type validation was re-written and improved, new control flow
  analysis was added to check for uniformity requirements. In addition, this
  step now collects the image-sampler pairs used by the module.
- Backends: lots of fixes and filling of the gaps
- Infrastructure: `convert` example was removed in favor of the default binary
  target. The native shaders (produced by the snapshot tests) got validated on
  CI using platform tools.

### [Distill][distill-github]

Distill is an asset pipeline for games, reading artist-friendly formats from
disk, processing them into your engine-ready formats, and delivering them to
your game runtime. Distill handles dependencies between assets, import & build
caching, cross-device hot reloading during development, packing assets for a
shippable game build, and more.

Distill's design is inspired by Unity's asset system and [Frostbite's Scaling
the Pipeline][distill-scaling-the-pipeline]. Distill leverages purity in the
functional-programming sense to deliver a robust and scalable experience for the
asset processing pipeline. With [LMDB][distill-lmdb] backing storage of
metadata, Distill is able to avoid blocking asset loading while assets are being
imported which eliminates the most common frustration with existing commercial
offerings. Additionally, Distill is able to provide fully consistent snapshots
of asset metadata to readers over [capnp-rpc][distill-capnp-rpc].

### [basis-universal-rs]

`basis-universal` provides bindings for [Binomial LLC][binomial-llc]'s [Basis
Universal texture codec][basis-universal-upstream].

Basis Universal is a state-of-the-art
[supercompressed][basis-universal-supercompression] texture codec that was
recently [open-sourced][basis-universal-open-sourced] by Binomial in partnership
with Google. It was [contributed][basis-universal-contributed-kronos] to the
Khronos glTF 3D Transmission Open Standard.

The library has two primary uses:

- Compresses and encode textures "offline" to a custom format
- Transcoding: Unpack the custom format directly to GPU-friendly compressed
  formats. The final format can be chosen at game runtime to be compatible with
  available GPU hardware.

Basis universal format can also store mipmapped textures and cubemaps, neither
of which is possible with "normal" file formats. Mipmaps can be generated by the
library during compression.

Compression is very slow (around 7-10s for a 2k texture) but transcoding is
relatively fast (around 5-40ms for a 2k texture depending on quality). Memory
savings at runtime are generally >= 75% (depending on the transcode format and
quality)

### [bevy_egui]

[bevy_egui] provides a [Egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) integration
for the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine.
It supports [bevy_webgl2] and implements the full set of Egui features
(such as clipboard and opening URLs).

This month versions 0.2 and 0.3 were released, providing an integration with
Egui 0.9 and 0.10 respectively.

Try out the [online demo](https://mvlabat.github.io/bevy_egui_web_showcase/index.html).

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

[Version 0.4][rkyv-v0.4] was released this month and brought some big changes
and improvements:

- Major traits have been refactored and renamed to clarify their roles
- Shared pointers (`Rc`, `Arc`, `Weak`) can now be serialized, deserialized, and
  validated with correct ownership semantics
- Serialization, deserialization, and validation all now support custom contexts
- Greatly improved support for 32- and 64-bit archives by implementing Archive
  for `usize` and `isize`
- More comprehensive documentation in the [book][rkyv-book]

This release completes the project's initial feature set, and a [request for
feedback][rkyv-request-for-feedback] has been opened to help with future project
planning.

### [wasm_plugin]

[wasm_plugin] is a new low-ish level tool for easily hosting WASM based plugins
for modding or scripting.

It consists of two crates:

- [wasm_plugin_host] which wraps a wasmer instance with methods for calling
  functions on the guest plugin.
- [wasm_plugin_guest] which provides an attribute macro to easily export
  functions to the host.
