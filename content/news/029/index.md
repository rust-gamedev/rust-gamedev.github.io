[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In December, Veloren ran a Christmas week. From the 20th to the 30th of
December, there were several winter-themed changes on the main server. Snow was
everywhere, decorations were added to locations, and NPC wore Christmas hats!
The 150th Veloren blog was also released in December. An experimental new
section of the newsletter gives video recaps of the last week's blog post.

The ability to edit the appearance of characters was added to the game. Work was
done on armor tooltips to make them more clear. Skiing is in the works, with
some work to still be done on animations and physics. New images were created
for item displays, which are now stored as .vox files.

> Is it really possible? YES it is! I managed to make a game 100% coded in Rust,
> but using Unity as editor and runtime.
> This has to be one of my craziest projects yet!
>
> I utilized a library called Bevy game framework/engine,
> to handle the gameplay programming. Utilizing Bevy systems I was able
> to hide the FFI code from the gameplay code.

## Tooling Updates

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack demo: Connecting visual nodes and tweaking various parameters to
procedurally generate a beveled box in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The project was recently announced, and an official open-source release is
planned during the following month. Here's a highlight of the upcoming features:

- A node-based editor to compose operations like 3d math, vertex/edge/face
  selections and mesh edit operations.
- Several polygon edit operations like bevel, chamfer and extrude.
- Viewport display with support for displaying primitive ids and triangle
  half-edge winding.

### [Graphite][graphite-repo]

![Graphite](graphite_splash.png)

Graphite ([GitHub][graphite-repo], [Discord][graphite-discord],
[Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is an in-development vector and raster graphics
editor built on a non-destructive node-based workflow.

The completion of [Sprint 10][graphite-sprint-10] wraps up a productive month
of features and stability improvements. Documents persist page reloads via
IndexedDB browser storage. The layer panel got some love. Vector anchor points
can be dragged (beginnings of the Path/Pen Tools). Per-tool footer bar hints
teach possible user input actions. And a big code cleanup/refactor took place
behind the scenes.

Additional new features and QoL improvements: artboards, panel resizing, the
Navigate Tool, outline view mode, support for touch input and non-Latin
keyboards, an *About Graphite* dialog with version info, plus dozens of bugs
and crashes were resolved.

[Try it right now in your browser.][graphite-live-demo] Graphite is making
steady progress towards becoming a non-destructive, procedural graphics editor
suitable for replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. [Join the
Discord][graphite-discord] and get involved!

### [Fun Notation][notation-fun]

![Demo that shows colored chords, notes, and tabs](fun-notation.gif)

[Fun Notation][notation-fun] ([GitHub][notation-fun-github]) is [@yjpark]'s
experimentation on musical notations built on top of Bevy.
The idea is to help with music visualization, practicing,
and provide a nicer way to show scores or tabs.

Some of current ideas tried in the app:

- colors for notes (based on the relative notation),
- color and shapes for chords,
- guitar tabs to show both pitch and durations for notes.

## Library Updates

### [assets_manager]

[assets_manager] provides a high-level API to load and cache external resources
with a focus on performance and hot-reloading.

In addition to built-in support for new formats like WebP, glTF and fonts,
[version 0.7] brings a few quality of life improvements. Additionally,
hot-reloading is now supported for custom asset sources.

These features led to a new crate: [ggez-assets_manager], whose goal is to ease
use of assets_manager with ggez engine!

[assets_manager]: https://github.com/a1phyr/assets_manager/
[version 0.7]: https://github.com/a1phyr/assets_manager/releases/tag/0.7.0

### [wgpu]-0.12 release

{{ image_figure(
    alt="albedo pathtracer"
    src="wgpu-pathtracer.png"
    caption="experimental pathtracer on wgpu from @llamajestic") }}

The team concluded 2021 with the release of wgpu-0.12 and naga-0.8.
Details can be found on the [gfx-rs blog] and [wgpu reddit discussion].
Lots of fixes are shipped alongside one much-awaited improvement:
the error messages from validating shaders were finally made readable:

```rust

### [Pixels] 0.9.0 👾

[Pixels] is a tiny hardware-accelerated pixel frame buffer. It is popularly
used for emulators, software renderers, 2D pixel art games, and desktop
utilities.

Version 0.9.0 brings a few breaking changes. Notably, wgpu was updated to
0.12 and it now requires Edition 2021. Full details are available in the
[release notes][pixels-changelog].

### [bevy_proto]

![YAML configuration files for bevy_proto](bevy_proto.png)

[bevy_proto] is a small plugin for the [Bevy] game engine, allowing entities to
be defined in their own config files (called "Prototypes"). These config files
are then read into a resource that you can use to spawn their pre-defined
entities from within any Bevy system.

The recently released 0.2 version, adds a templating feature (as suggested
by [@chrisburnor](https://github.com/chrisburnor)). This new feature allows any
entity prototype to define one or more templates, from which it will inherit
additional component definitions (including those from a template's templates).

This makes defining many entities with common functionality (such as enemy types
or weapons) much easier and reduces code duplication for an overall better
experience.

For more info, check out
the [original PR](https://github.com/MrGVSV/bevy_proto/pull/2), or explore
the [assets](https://github.com/MrGVSV/bevy_proto/tree/main/assets)

### [bevy-remote-devtools]

![Demo of the Tauri based development app](bevy-remote-devtools.gif)

[bevy-remote-devtools] is a plugin and UI application for the [Bevy] game
engine allowing to view entities and their components, asset resources
like meshes, events from the [tracing] crate and system timings using a
very basic profiler. It also supports all of that over network so
debugging can be done from any remote machine and vice versa.

The first release of the 0.1 version comes with basic support for the
aforementioned features. It contains a plugin for [Bevy] that will extend
you application with a small REST HTTP API that can be consumed by the
included [Tauri] based UI application.

[kajiya] ([Discord][kajiya_discord])
by [@h3r2tic] is an experimental real-time global illumination
renderer made with Vulkan, and utilizing [rust-gpu][rust-gpu].

Last month the project was released into open source along with
a tiny sample: [Cornell McRay t'Racing][cornell-mcray].

The renderer is permissively licensed, and includes several cutting-edge
algorithms, including ray-traced effects.
It isn’t built to ship games (yet), but serves as a convenient
platform for learning and research.

### [rapid-qoi]

[rapid-qoi] by @zakarumych is an implementation of QOI format written in Rust.

QOI format can fit nicely as a replacement for PNG
and other common loseless image formats
for game engines given its simplicity and blazing fast encoding and decoding.

[rapid-qoi] has a simple API, zero unsafe, zero dependencies,
fast build times and high performance.
It is compatible with finalized QOI spec published in December.

### [ash] v0.34

[ash] is lightweight wrapper around Vulkan.

This month [v0.34 was released][ash-0-3-4]. Highlights include:

- Now ash defaults to linking Vulkan directly, which saves the libloading dep
  and is more idiomatic for apps that don't have a fallback.
- Debug impls can be disabled for a faster build.
- More extensions and lots of miscellaneous API cleanup.
