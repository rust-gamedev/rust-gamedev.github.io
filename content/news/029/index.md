Welcome to the 29th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Tet-Rust][tetrust-github]

![Tet-Rust screenshot](tet-rust-1-sm.gif)
_Screenshot of Tet-Rust_

Tet-Rust ([GitHub][tetrust-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a mini game based on the famous falling puzzle
block game.

The game was created to exercise Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw] and is
part of an open source [repository][s9-minigame-repo] of several mini-games
that use this framework.

### The Beast of Monte Carlo

_Screenshot of The Beast of Monte Carlo_

The Beast of Monte Carlo by [@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a mini role-playing
game in development to help work out new features for Syn9's
[Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].

This month's progress included:

- prototyping tilemap and frame-based animation to make a simple walkaround
engine
- creating a general purpose maze generation algorithm and porting random world
map generation from C++ to Rust
- creating new sprite artwork and animation, as well as mocking up the battle
system

The gameplay and art is influenced by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Lufia
II with a heavy focus on procedural content generation.

### Country Slice

![Country Slice](country_slice.gif)

[Country Slice][country-slice-github] is
[@anastasiaopara][country-slice-twitter]'s hobby project, where users can draw a
small scene, and their input is amplified with real-time procedural
generation.

This month's biggest update was adding an ability to draw
paths that, if intersected with walls, automatically generate arches. You can
read a twitter thread that brifly covers how it 
[was optimized to run in 1-2ms][country-slice-twitter-opt].

## Learning Material Updates

## Tooling Updates

## Library Updates

### [assets_manager]

[assets_manager] provides a high-level API to load and cache external resources
with a focus on performance and hot-reloading.

In addition to built-in support for new formats like WebP, glTF and fonts,
[version 0.7] brings a few quality of life improvements. Additionnally,
hot-reloading is now supported for custom asset sources.

These features led to a new crate: [ggez-assets_manager], whose goal is to ease
use of assets_manager with ggez engine!

[version 0.7]: https://github.com/a1phyr/assets_manager/releases/tag/0.7.0

### [wgpu]-0.12 release

![albedo pathtracer](wgpu-pathtracer.png)
_experimental pathtracer on wgpu from @llamajestic_

The team concluded 2021 with the release of wgpu-0.12 and naga-0.8.
Details can be found on the [gfx-rs blog] and [wgpu reddit discussion].
Lots of fixes are shipped alongside one much-awaited improvement:
the error messages from validating shaders were finally made readable:

```rust
   â”Œâ”€ interpolate.wgsl:21:25
   â”‚
21 â”‚    out.linear_centroid = vec2<f32>(64.0, 125.0, 1.0);
   â”‚                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ naga::Expression [16]

Entry point vert_main at Vertex is invalid: 
        Expression [16] is invalid
        Composing expects 2 components but 3 were given
```

### [Pixels] 0.9.0 ðŸ‘¾

[Pixels] is a tiny hardware-accelerated pixel frame buffer. It is popularly
used for emulators, software renderers, 2D pixel art games, and desktop
utilities.

Version 0.9.0 brings a few breaking changes. Notably `wgpu` was updated to
0.12 and it now requires Edition 2021. Full details are available in the
[release notes][pixels-changelog].
