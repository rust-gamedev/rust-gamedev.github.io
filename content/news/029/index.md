Welcome to the 29th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

Tet-Rust ([GitHub][tetrust-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a mini game based on the famous falling puzzle
block game.

The game was created to exercise Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw] and is
part of an open source [repository][s9-minigame-repo] of several mini-games
that use this framework.

The Beast of Monte Carlo by [@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a mini role-playing
game in development to help work out new features for Syn9's
[Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].

This month's progress included:

* prototyping tilemap and frame-based animation to make a simple walkaround
engine
* creating a general purpose maze generation algorithm and porting random world
map generation from C++ to Rust
* creating new sprite artwork and animation, as well as mocking up the battle
system

The gameplay and art is influenced by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Lufia
II with a heavy focus on procedural content generation.
