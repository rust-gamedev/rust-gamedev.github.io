Welcome to the 29th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### [Tet-Rust][tetrust-github]

_Screenshot of Tet-Rust_

Tet-Rust ([GitHub][tetrust-github]) by
[@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a mini game based on the famous falling puzzle
block game.

The game was created to exercise Syn9's [Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw] and is
part of an open source [repository][s9-minigame-repo] of several mini-games
that use this framework.

### The Beast of Monte Carlo

_Screenshot of The Beast of Monte Carlo_

The Beast of Monte Carlo by [@Syn-Nine][synnine-twitter] is a mini role-playing
game in development to help work out new features for Syn9's
[Rust Mini Game Framework][mgfw].

This month's progress included:

- prototyping tilemap and frame-based animation to make a simple walkaround
engine
- creating a general purpose maze generation algorithm and porting random world
map generation from C++ to Rust
- creating new sprite artwork and animation, as well as mocking up the battle
system

The gameplay and art is influenced by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Lufia
II with a heavy focus on procedural content generation.

### [10x Sprint Master]

![In-game screenshot of 10x Sprint Master,

[10x Sprint Master] ([GitHub][10xsprintmaster-github]) by [@E_net4]
is a simulation game where you play the role of
a software development lead engineer.
Write tasks, coordinate a team of developers,
fix bugs and manage feature delivery,
while trying to mitigate the torments of technical debt.

The game was submitted to GitHub Game Off 2021,
and was written using [Yew] with graphics done in pure HTML and CSS.

The author also published a [blog post on Dev.to][10xsprintmaster-dev]
about the game's technical and social dimensions.

## Engine Updates

### [Rusty Engine 3.0]

![An example Rusty Engine game](rusty_engine3.png)
_The "Road Race" game prototype running under Rusty Engine 3.0_

[Rusty Engine] by [Nathan Stocks] is a game engine for people who are learning Rust.

Version 3.0 is a large release with many breaking changes. Notable new features
include: [a full tutorial], custom asset loading (sprites, sounds, fonts),
customizable game state, an interactive collider creator, and much more.
See [the changelog for 3.0] for the full details.

## Tooling Updates

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack demo: Connecting visual nodes and tweaking various parameters to
procedurally generate a beveled box in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modelling application made in Rust,
using `rend3`, `wgpu` and `egui`. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The project was recently announced, and an official open-source release is
planned during the following month. Here's a highlight of the upcoming features:

- A node-based editor to compose operations like 3d math, vertex/edge/face
  selections and mesh edit operations.
- Several polygon edit operations like bevel, chamfer and extrude.
- Viewport display with support for displaying primitive ids and triangle
  half-edge winding.

### [Graphite][graphite-repo]

![Graphite](graphite_splash.png)

Graphite ([GitHub][graphite-repo], [Discord][graphite-discord],
[Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is an in-development vector and raster graphics
editor built on a non-destructive node-based workflow.

The completion of [Sprint 10][graphite-sprint-10] wraps up a productive month
of features and stability improvements. Documents persist page reloads via
IndexedDB browser storage. The layer panel got some love. Vector anchor points
can be dragged (beginnings of the Path/Pen Tools). Per-tool footer bar hints
teach possible user input actions. And a big code cleanup/refactor took place
behind the scenes.

Additional new features and QoL improvements: artboards, panel resizing, the
Navigate Tool, outline view mode, support for touch input and non-Latin
keyboards, an *About Graphite* dialog with version info, plus dozens of bugs
and crashes were resolved.

[Try it right now in your browser.][graphite-live-demo] Graphite is making
steady progress towards becoming a non-destructive, procedural graphics editor
suitable for replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. [Join the
Discord][graphite-discord] and get involved!

## Library Updates

### [assets_manager]

[assets_manager] provides a high-level API to load and cache external resources
with a focus on performance and hot-reloading.

In addition to built-in support for new formats like WebP, glTF and fonts,
[version 0.7] brings a few quality of life improvements. Additionnally,
hot-reloading is now supported for custom asset sources.

These features led to a new crate: [ggez-assets_manager], whose goal is to ease
use of assets_manager with ggez engine!

[assets_manager]: https://github.com/a1phyr/assets_manager/
[version 0.7]: https://github.com/a1phyr/assets_manager/releases/tag/0.7.0
[ggez-assets_manager]: https://github.com/a1phyr/ggez-assets_manager/

### [wgpu]-0.12 release

![albedo pathtracer](wgpu-pathtracer.png)
_experimental pathtracer on wgpu from @llamajestic_

The team concluded 2021 with the release of wgpu-0.12 and naga-0.8.
Details can be found on the [gfx-rs blog] and [wgpu reddit discussion].
Lots of fixes are shipped alongside one much-awaited improvement:
the error messages from validating shaders were finally made readable:

```rust
   â”Œâ”€ interpolate.wgsl:21:25
   â”‚
21 â”‚    out.linear_centroid = vec2<f32>(64.0, 125.0, 1.0);
   â”‚                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ naga::Expression [16]

Entry point vert_main at Vertex is invalid: 
        Expression [16] is invalid

```

### [Pixels] 0.9.0 ðŸ‘¾

[Pixels] is a tiny hardware-accelerated pixel frame buffer. It is popularly
used for emulators, software renderers, 2D pixel art games, and desktop
utilities.

Version 0.9.0 brings a few breaking changes. Notably `wgpu` was updated to
0.12 and it now requires Edition 2021. Full details are available in the
[release notes][pixels-changelog].
