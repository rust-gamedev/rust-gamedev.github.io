Welcome to the 45th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_hundreds of npcs smoothly interpolating_

CyberGate ([YouTube][cybergate-yt], [Discord][cybergate-dis]),
an ambitious multiplayer project in development by CyberSoul,
aims to invite players into a constantly evolving universe.
Harnessing the power of procedural generation and artificial intelligence,
this work-in-progress aspires to provide an engaging experience
that emphasizes exploration and discovery across its diverse worlds.

The latest updates to CyberGate include:

- Networking Interpolation version 2:
  increased reliability over frame rate changes,
  improved accuracy of object motion and detail by ~20%,
  and objects update 12-45 milliseconds faster.
- Server compilation was drastically simplified (100x faster).
- Improved browser server process, to have more consistent behavior.
- Improved mouse lock on browsers.
- Simplified code related to state synchronization.
- Significant gameplay changes and bug fixes.

They are currecntly working on universe generation alghoritms for version 8.0.
Participate [by joining the Discord server][cybergate-dis].

### [Jumpy]

![Online Matchmaking Menu Page](jumpy.png)
_Online Matchmaking_

[Jumpy] ([GitHub][Jumpy], [Discord][jumpy_discord], [Twitter][jumpy_twitter]) by
[Spicy Lobster][spicy_lobster] is a pixel-style, tactical 2D shooter with a fishy
theme.

In the last month, Jumpy released [v0.7.0][jumpy_v0.7.0] with support for online
and LAN network games! Networking has been a long time comming, with many
architecture decisions being made specifically with networking in mind. While
network performance may still need to be tweaked, and there are still some bugs
to fix, the proof-of-concept was a success. You can start matches on your local
network, or online, with no configuration necessary!

The Fish Folk game series has a [pre-launch page up on Kickstarter][jumpy_ks],
expected to go public in mid-May.

### [Thetawave][thetawave-itch]

Thetawave is an open-source, physics based, space shooter game.
This month, Thetawave 0.1.0 was [released][thetawave-release].
The main features of this update were:

- local multiplayer
- a second character
- many sprite adjustments
- many gameplay tweaks from in-person playtesting with
  the [thetawave arcade cabinet][thetawave-arcade]

![thetawave-gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thetawavegame/thetawave/main/assets/images/formation_spawn.gif)

The easist way to play the most up to date version of Thetawave
on your machine is to download it through the
[Spicy Launcher][spicy-launcher]. Otherwise, you can play the game in your
browser on the [itch.io page][thetawave-itch].

_Game of Life Simulation_

[Yendor][yendor] published [a mini-tutorial series][exploring-gol-blog]
exploring compute shaders in Bevy using their [Game of Life example][bevy-gol]
and adding some new featues to it: camera controller, wrapping simulation, and
drawing on the simulation.

## Tooling Updates

### [Rustracer][rustracer]

[![Youtube screenshot: demo with a couple of cars inside a box](
rustracer.jpg)][rustracer-0.2.0 demo]

Rustracer, a PBR [glTF 2.0][glrf-2-0] renderer based on Vulkan ray-tracing.
It can render (almost) any glTF 2.0 scene by pure path tracing at an interacive speed.
Compared with rasterization-based glTF renderers, Rustracer needs some
(scene-dependent) time for sample accumulation in exchange for global illumination.

On top of that, the control panel provides a rich set of viewing options
and debugging utilities.

It also can serve as a glTF viewer or a reference renderer.

The code base itself is a learning resource for [Ash] (Vulkan bindings in Rust),
hardware ray tracing and glTF processing in Rust.

## Library Updates

### [Backpack]

![left part is "crab simulator" game where the player gains an item
right part is "clash of crabs" where player is able to use the item](backpack.jpg)
_Minimalist schema for sharing items in different games_

[Backpack] is an inventory system to share items between different games,
for example:

- Raise a crab in Crab Simulator,
- Make it fight in Crab Shooter,
- Cook it in Crab Cook...
- Gain a crab skin in your favorite game!

[Backpack] is in a pre-MVP state: a tech prototype is working.

The project is not affiliated or related to Blockchain/NFTs:
it uses a PostgreSQL DB to store users, games and items.
Authentication is done via email/password,
third party authentication via OAuth will be a future goal.
An Authenticated user can create apps and add item definitions to these.
Other users can get an independant instance of that item and modify its data.

The next project milestone is
2 minimalist interconnected games released by the end of 2023.
