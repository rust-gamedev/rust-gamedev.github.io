Welcome to the 45th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

this work-in-progress aspires to provide an engaging experience
that emphasizes exploration and discovery across its diverse worlds.

The latest updates to CyberGate include:

- Networking Interpolation version 2:
  increased reliability over frame rate changes,
  improved accuracy of object motion and detail by ~20%,
  and objects update 12-45 milliseconds faster.
- Server compilation was drastically simplified (100x faster).
- Improved browser server process, to have more consistent behavior.
- Improved mouse lock on browsers.
- Simplified code related to state synchronization.
- Significant gameplay changes and bug fixes.

## Engine Updates

### [godot-rust][gd-github]

![godot-rust GDExtension logo](godot-rust-gdext.png)

The Godot 4 binding for Rust, also known as [gdext][gd-gdext], now features
[a reworked website][gd-website]. The site acts as a hub to all the relevant
resources and community platforms. It also hosts auto-generated API docs
from `cargo doc`, for latest snapshots and active pull requests.

On the library side, April has brought [lots of improvements][gd-pulse]
regarding engine interaction, notably:

- FFI bugfixes ([#234][gd-234], [#249][gd-249], [#250][gd-250])
- Class constants and notifications ([#219][gd-219], [#223][gd-223])
- `Callable` support ([#231][gd-231])
- Initial threading experiments ([#212][gd-212])

For the near future, the plan is to iron out the new website and CI, as well
as some QoL improvements such as better compile times.
