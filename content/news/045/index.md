### [Rusty Jam 3][rustyjam3-itch]

Another Rusty Jam starts on May 21st!

It's a great chance to try out some new Rusty tech, form a team of like-minded rustaceans,
and feel what a full cycle of making a game in Rust feels like in miniature!

This jam focuses more on using Rust than anything else.
That means you aren't restricted on your design, music, or graphics,
as long as you use Rust to make it!

The optional-to-use theme for the jam is going to be announced
in [the jam's Discord][rustyjam3-dis] and pinned in the community section.
While you're waiting for the theme, you can start looking for a team
in the looking-for-team Discord channel.
If you want solo though, that's fine too.

## Engine Updates

### [Ambient][ambient-github]

![a set of cool and mostly physics-centered demos](ambient.gif)
_A 10-second preview of what's possible with Ambient 0.2_

[Ambient 0.2][ambient-blog] is now out after two months of development.
Ambient is an open-source runtime for building high-performance multiplayer
games and 3D applications powered by WebAssembly, Rust and WebGPU. Projects
consist of assets and logic built around the currently Rust-only Ambient API,
and these projects can be loaded by any compatible runtime running on any
platform.

This release brings a few major features, including basic support for playing
sounds, being able to run WASM on the client (in addition to the server), and
automatic proxying of servers by the Ambient Proxy. This allows anyone with
the URL to connect to a server, without having to worry about port forwarding.

Finally, Ambient UI can now be used from guest code. Combined with networking
and ECS, this unlocks an exciting new capability: multiplayer UI! The blog post
walks through the creation of a basic multiplayer beat sequencer using these
features.

Check out [the GitHub][ambient-github] to get started with building for/or
on Ambient yourself, or chat with the developers and other explorers on
[the Discord][ambient-discord].

## Tooling Updates

### [Rustracer][rustracer]

[![Youtube screenshot: demo with a couple of cars inside a box](
rustracer.jpg)][rustracer-0.2.0 demo]

Rustracer, a PBR [glTF 2.0][glrf-2-0] renderer based on Vulkan ray-tracing.
It can render (almost) any glTF 2.0 scene by pure path tracing
at an interactive speed.
Compared with rasterization-based glTF renderers, Rustracer needs some
(scene-dependent) time for sample accumulation in exchange for global illumination.

On top of that, the control panel provides a rich set of viewing options
and debugging utilities.

It also can serve as a glTF viewer or a reference renderer.

The code base itself is a learning resource for [Ash] (Vulkan bindings in Rust),
hardware ray tracing and glTF processing in Rust.

### [Luminol][luminol]

![tile map editor and other tool windows like command event editor](luminol.png)

[Luminol][luminol] by [@speak2erase] and [@somedevfox] is a remake
of the RPG Maker editor, based mostly off of [RPG Maker XP][RMXP]
(aka RMXP), with the intent of creating a more modern, feature rich,
and open source version of RMXP.

RGSS, RMXP's runtime, has already been open sourced thanks to [mkxp].
However, despite several attempts, no one has fully remade the editor.
There are [some tools][r48] out there that cover some of its functionality,
but none are user friendly, nor feature complete.

RGSS is actually quite enjoyable to use. The actual editor though - not so much:
dated and often unintuitive UI, extensibility issues,
binary format that is allergic to source control,
and arbitrary limits that never existed in previous versions.
Luminol was born out of sheer frustration from dealing with these issues -
and hopes to fix them!

Luminol's key differences:

- Completely GPU accelerated (RMXP is software rendered).
- Edit multiple maps at the same time.
- Multiple data formats.
- Edit encrypted archives (rgssad).
- Open-source.
- Better user experience overall.

Luminol is currently looking for contributors:
[there is a lot to be done][luminol-issues].
If you'd like to help contribute, please reach out to [@speak2erase]!

### [Graphite][graphite-website]

![Graphite logo](graphite.png)

Graphite ([website][graphite-website], [GitHub][graphite-repo],
[Discord][graphite-discord], [Twitter][graphite-twitter]) is a free,
in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor based around a Rust-powered
node graph compositing engine.

April's [sprint 25][graphite-sprint-25] developments:

- Brushing up: The new Brush tool makes it possible to paint raster-based art.
- Writing down: A refactor of the Text tool integrates typographic content in
  the node graph. Finally, all artwork types are node-based.
- Showing true colors: Node graph compositing now uses linear, not gamma,
  color. Key new color adjustment nodes are added.
- Laying the groundwork: Further engineering work prepares the node graph
  language for GPU execution. And development continues toward in-graph layer
  stack compositing.

As always, new contributors are cordially invited to
[get involved][graphite-contribute] and take on
[approachable issues][graphite-approachable-issues] with help from the
project's friendly and supportive developer community on Discord.

[Image Maniac][im] is a cross-platform image viewer designed for game developers
and other creative professionals. The project's features include:

- Infinite canvas for drag-n-dropping many images onto the main window,
  and view them all in a single, unified workspace.
- Quick RGBA channel switching using number keys is usefil for
  game developers who work with textures and materials.
- Broad format support including PNG, JPG, BMP, DDS, TGA, KTX2, and HDR.
- Focus on performance even with large files and multiple image at once.

## Library Updates

### [Backpack]

![left part is "crab simulator" game where the player gains an item
right part is "clash of crabs" where player is able to use the item](backpack.jpg)
_Minimalist schema for sharing items in different games_

[Backpack] is an inventory system to share items between different games,
for example:

- Raise a crab in Crab Simulator,
- Make it fight in Crab Shooter,
- Cook it in Crab Cook...
- Gain a crab skin in your favorite game!

[Backpack] is in a pre-MVP state: a tech prototype is working.

The project is not affiliated or related to Blockchain/NFTs:
it uses a PostgreSQL DB to store users, games and items.
Authentication is done via email/password,
third party authentication via OAuth will be a future goal.
An Authenticated user can create apps and add item definitions to these.
Other users can get an independent instance of that item and modify its data.

The next project milestone is
2 minimalist interconnected games released by the end of 2023.
