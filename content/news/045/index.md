Welcome to the 45th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_hundreds of npcs smoothly interpolating_

CyberGate ([YouTube][cybergate-yt], [Discord][cybergate-dis]),
an ambitious multiplayer project in development by CyberSoul,
aims to invite players into a constantly evolving universe.
Harnessing the power of procedural generation and artificial intelligence,
this work-in-progress aspires to provide an engaging experience
that emphasizes exploration and discovery across its diverse worlds.

The latest updates to CyberGate include:

- Networking Interpolation version 2:
  increased reliability over frame rate changes,
  improved accuracy of object motion and detail by ~20%,
  and objects update 12-45 milliseconds faster.
- Server compilation was drastically simplified (100x faster).
- Improved browser server process, to have more consistent behavior.
- Improved mouse lock on browsers.
- Simplified code related to state synchronization.
- Significant gameplay changes and bug fixes.

They are currecntly working on universe generation alghoritms for version 8.0.

Rustracer, a PBR [glTF 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/gltf) renderer based on Vulkan ray-tracing.
It can render (almost) any glTF 2.0 scene by pure path tracing at an interacive speed.
Compared with rasterization-based glTF renderers, Rustracer needs some (scene-dependent) time for 
sample accumulation in exchange for global illumination.

On top of that, the control panel provides a rich set of viewing options and debugging utilities.

It can serve as a glTF viewer or a reference renderer.

The code base itself is a learning resource for [Ash][Ash](Vulkan bindings in Rust), hardware ray tracing 
and glTF processing in Rust.
