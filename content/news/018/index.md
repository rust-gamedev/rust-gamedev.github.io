Welcome to the 18th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Rust GameDev Meetup

![Gamedev meetup poster](gamedev-meetup.png)

The first iteration of the Rust Gamedev Meetup happened in January. It was an
opportunity for developers to show of what Rust projects they've been working on
in the game ecosystem. Developers showed off physics engines, custom build
tools, renderers, and more. You can watch the recording of the meetup [here on
Youtube][gamedev-meetup-video].

The next meetup will take place 13th of February
at 16:00 GMT on the [Rust Gamedev Discord server][rust-gamedev-discord], and can
also be [streamed on Twitch][rust-gamedev-twitch].

### [SeniorSKY]

![SeniorSKY](3.png)
_Over the mountains in Slovakia_

[SeniorSKY]
is a flight simulator which uses Vulkan API, developed by [@pmathia0].
As an aerospace engineering student, Peter has always been interested how
a flight simulator works under the hood.
The development of SeniorSKY started as a hobby project during university
studies.

SeniorSKY uses real-world elevation data with 1 arc
second precision and can render the whole globe in real dimensions.
During the flight, the terrain tiles are loaded dynamically based
on real GPS coordinates of airplane, with a decreasing level of detail
further from the camera. This is achieved using a combination
of a terrain-quad-tree and GPU tessellation.

SeniorSKY also implements basic rendering of sky, atmosphere and fog.

To be able to simulate a flight, the application temporarily integrates 3rd party
flight dynamics engine called JSBSim. Meanwhile, development of own, custom
flight dynamics is already in progress.

_Solving puzzles to build towers_

[Oicana][oicana] is a tower defense game with puzzle aspects submitted to Mini
jam 71 [on itch][oicana-itch] by [M1nd0fRafa3l][rafael-itch] and
[@nikl_me][nikl-twitter]. The game was written using the Rust game engine
[Bevy][bevy].

Colorless puzzle pieces try to reach your base. Your towers have to shoot at
the pieces to uncover their color. After defeating a piece, it will try to run
away and you should catch it to upgrade your towers or build new ones.

Following the game jam the tower upgrades where improved and game audio was
changed to use [Kira][kira-sound] via an
[experimental bevy plugin][kira-plugin].

in the spirit of "Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past".

for a future commercial game, along with a custom 2D engine
built on top of [Bevy].

The engine, which is unnamed so far, will be Open Sourced soon and will be
designed to make it very easy to make games with a similar gameplay and style,
primarily by simply writing YAML configuration files and integrating with
[LDtk].

- An in-game feedback button that people can use to report bugs or
just give general feedback.
- All random numbers are from seeded generators so it makes bugs easier
to reproduce.
- A big chunk of a replay system is finished.
This should help a lot with reproducing issues. Plus, it's really fun to watch.

rendering and culling systems.

If you're interested in keeping a closer eye on the project and monitor
it's progress,
you can join the game's [discord channel][dwarf-world-discord].

## Library & Tooling Updates

### [rkyv]

[rkyv] is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust. It's similar to
FlatBuffers and Cap'n Proto and can be used for data storage and messaging.

Version 0.3 was released this month and brought some highly-requested features:

- A new hashmap implementation using perfect hashing to decrease memory usage
  and fix portability issues.
- The `Unarchive` trait to enable more traditional data deserialization for
  archived types.
- Improved validation performance.
- Better error messages and API ergonomics.
- A [book][rkyv-book] with more narrative documentation on architecture and
  internals.
- More tests and realistic benchmarks against other popular serialization
  frameworks.

The next update will be [v0.4][rkyv-v0.4] and is on the way soon with a release
date around mid-February.

### [GameLisp][gamelisp] v0.2

![logo](glisp-logo.png)

[GameLisp][gamelisp] ([source code][gamelisp-src],
[playground][gamelisp-playground]) by [@fleabitdev]
is a scripting language designed specifically for Rust game development.

This month, version 0.2.0 has been released. Some of the updates:

- Any `'static` Rust type, including types defined by external crates,
  can now be moved onto the garbage-collected heap and manipulated
  by GameLisp scripts.
- Rust data on the garbage-collected heap can now contain pointers to other
  garbage-collected data, by implementing a `trace()` method.
- Version 0.1 could only bind non-capturing Rust closures, but closures
  which capture `'static` data are now fully supported.
- Rust function pointers can now be passed directly to GameLisp,
  rather than using the `rfn!` macro.
  The clunky `lib!` and `rdata!` macros have also been removed.
- Updated documentation starting from the ["Rust Bindings"][gamelisp-doc-bindings]
  chapter.

For full details, see the [changelog][gamelisp-changelog].

### [gfx-rs] and [wgpu-rs]

![Spaceship](wgpu-spaceship.jpg)

The community managed to squeeze the v0.7 releases out
at the end of the month. See the detailed notes on [gfx blog post].

The highlight of the show is about shaders. Most of wgpu-rs shaders are
now written in [WGSL],
and gfx-rs community is inviting Rust game/graphics developers to evaluate if
[naga] could fulfill their shader translation needs in the future.

### [chess-engine]

![cli + web version](chess.png)
_Console and web clients for the chess-engine_

[chess-engine] by [@adam-mcdaniel] is a pure Rust, no-std, dependency-free
chess engine built to run anywhere.

> I love chess a lot. It's definitely one of my favorite games ever.
> However, I've always been disappointed when trying to write programs
> that play chess digitally (particularly in a compiled language).
> Although several amazing engines exist, it's near impossible to find
> a neat library for chess-related-programming that runs on everything.
>
> [chess-engine] is a solution to my problem.
> If you want a chess engine that runs on embedded devices, the terminal,
> [the desktop (with a gui)][chess-gui], and [the web][chess-web],
> this is probably your best bet.
