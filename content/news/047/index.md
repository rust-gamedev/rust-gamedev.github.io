Welcome to the 47th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Macroquad examples rendered by Metal API_

Macroquad got ported to miniquad-0.4, supporting Metal on Mac and IOS.

On the surface all the macroquad API stayed exactly the same, but with
`use macroquad::miniquad::*` being such a breaking change - major version
number was bumped. Major version bump made possible to fix a few
long-lasting issues, check the [full changelog][macroquad_changelog]
for all the changes.
