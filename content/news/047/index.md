Welcome to the 47th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Space Frontiers]

_Render achieved with dynamic point lights._

[Space Frontiers] ([GitHub], [Discord], [Twitter], [Reddit], [Steam Group])
by [Starwolves] is an online moddable sci-fi action RPG community game
simulating space (and spaceships) in 3D.

By the end of last year the client was made with Godot. Shortly after that the
decision was made to replace the Godot project with a [Bevy Engine] client.

Rust and Bevy are now used for both server and client.
There are a lot of advantages such as sharing libraries and neat code replication,
reducing code overhead.
In-fact both the server and client are now developed in [the same virtual workspace].

The client includes a new camera perspective from top-down isometric to 1st person.
A new 3D dynamic gridmap framework has been successfully implemented in ECS.
Inspired by the videogame "System Shock".
The prototype includes an in-game map editing tool with the ability to export to
file.

The project is commercial, [open-source] and has a proprietary license.
There is a milestone for a license change to free open-source.

[Starwolves.io Bulletin Board] was launched half a year ago.
There are 25~ registrants left that can receive a permanent unique forum group/title.
