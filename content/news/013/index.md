## [Rust GameDev Podcast][podcast]

![text logo](podcast.jpeg)

This month [Richard @patchfx Patching][richardpatching] started
[Rust GameDev Podcast][podcast]!

> Over the lockdown period I have been working on a new podcast
> for Rust game developers. I have been interviewing indie teams
> and library creators, discussing custom engines, procedural generation,
> open source and the business of games development.

- [The first episode][podcast-1] is an interview
  with the team behind Veloren, an open-source multiplayer
  voxel RPG written in Rust.

  Find out about the game's origin, its engine development,
  pros and cons of a big open-source project, CI and build pipeline,
  importance of artists, procedural generation,
  community building, managing players' expectations,
  and upcoming developments.

- [The second episode][podcast-2] is an interview with Herbert Wolverson,
  creator of [bracket-lib] (pka RLTK), [Rust Roguelike Tutorial][rltut],
  and [Nox Futura][noxf].

  A very wide-ranging interview covering many interesting topics:
  where the bracket-lib came from and what the creator is doing now,
  as well as practical questions and issues discovered
  in the course of creating their game, [Nox Futura].
  Lots of interesting talk about a new Rust games development book
  Herbert is writing, C++ vs Rust, learning Rust, code architecture and
  ECS's in roguelikes, emergent behavior, and hilarious bugs in Dwarf Fortress.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Landscape](veloren-landscape1.jpeg)
_Landscape with new LoD and lighting_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In August, Veloren 0.7 was released! Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, also got
updated to 0.4.0. Veloren was featured in the inaugural episode of the [Rust
Game Dev Podcast][veloren-interview]. Although the 0.7 release party saw the
largest number of concurrent players at 57, it ran into some significant issues
which you can read about below.

The largest merge in Veloren so far also happened in August. It included
monumental changes to lighting and added level of detail functionality to see
far-off mountains. Lots of work has been done on the animation, combat, SFX, and
UX front. Animations for movement and combat were added and improved. Work
continued on particle systems, which have been added to Veloren in places like
campfires, fireworks, and weapons.

![Healing sceptre](veloren-sceptre.gif)
_Healing sceptre with the new particle system_

You can read more about some specific topics from August:

[#83](https://veloren.net/devblog-83).

In September, work on 0.8 will continue. Some large systems being worked on
include networking, improved persistence stability, and player experience. Game
design is working on improving the connection between the experience a new
player has, and the current game design. The in-progress 0.8 version will likely
be completed more quickly than 0.7, as to not include too many changes.

### [Egregoria]

![Egregoria buildings screenshot](egregoria.png)

[Egregoria]'s objective is to become a granular society simulation,
filled with fully autonomous agents interacting with their world in real time.
Egregoria was previously known as Scale,
but was renamed to fit the theme better.

The [5th devlog][egregoria-blog-post] was published, talking about
the renaming, project management, buildings and scripting.

A [Discord][egregoria-discord] server was launched to discuss the project.

### [Cary]

[![Dodging bullets and carrying Cary to temporary safety](cary_screenshot.png)][Cary]

In [Cary] the player has to bring the titular character to the exit by carrying
them or otherwise making sure they don't – nor the player themselves –
touch any of the traps.
Easier said than done when you have limited stamina and Cary keeps running
into spikes.

Made with hecs and wgpu (no framework), but uses WebGL on the web
because of the current implementation status of WebGPU.

Made during the [Extra Credits game jam][extra-credits-jam],
it's a rather small game.
It can be played in the browser or downloaded at [itch.io][Cary].

### [Way of Rhea]

[![Anthropic's virtual booth at Play NYC](way-of-rhea-play-nyc.png)][Way of Rhea]
_Anthropic's virtual booth at [Play NYC]_

[Way of Rhea] is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world where you can
only interact with items that match your current color.

Way of Rhea has a [free Steam demo][Way of Rhea] temporarily available as part of
[Play NYC]!
The new demo includes a level that wasn't part of the Steam Game Festival,
showing off how circuit puzzles will work in the game. Since Play NYC
couldn't be in person this year, the devs temporarily themed this level to look
like last year's Play NYC venue, included placing virtual booths for other games
throughout the level.

### [Chillscapes][chillscapes-itch]

![Chillscapes Main Menu](chillscapes_main_menu.png)

[Chillscapes][chillscapes-github] is a lo-fi
rhythm experience created for the [NEOC#03 Rhythm Game Jam][neoc]. Using
layerable lo-fi music tracks, the game has you tap with the rhythm of the loops
being added, before changing the music up by adding another loop into the mix.
Last week, [a retrospective update was published][chillscapes-retrospective]
reflecting on what the developer's takeaways were from the experience.

Chillscapes is written using an early-in-development 2d engine,
[Kludgine][kludgine]. For audio playback, rodio was utilized. The source code is
[available on GitHub][chillscapes-github].

### [SIMple Physics][simple-physics-site]

[![SIMple Mechanics wave preset](simple-physics-wave.gif)][simple-physics-gifs]
_One of SIMple Mechanic's Lua presets, a colorful wave of bouncing circles_

[SIMple Physics][simple-physics-site] by [@mkhan45] is a set of educational physics
simulators meant to help students and teachers conduct labs without expensive equipment
or in person classes. Each simulator uses serializable graphs, object inspection,
Lua scripting, and a few other features to help students learn. Currently, there
is a simulator for mechanics/projectile motion and one for universal gravitation,
but the goal is to include one for electronics/magnetism and one for waves/optics.

Written in Rust using `ggez`, `specs`, `imgui-rs`, and `nphysics`,
this project's goals include:
performance, accessibility/portability, ease of use, and extensibility.

### [Event Chaining as a Decoupling Method in ECS][event-chaining]

![graph: FileSignal -> AssetSignal -> AssetEvent](event-chain-assets-graph.png)

[@jojolepro] released a [blog post][event-chaining] that provides
an in-depth look at how using events in entity-component-system architectures
can improve system reusability dramatically.

Using events in this way also allows for:

- easier testing,
- additional configurability,
- possible performance improvements,
- higher reusability - especially if using generics.

The blog also has an [RSS feed][jojolepro-rss] and more in-depth posts about
game development are planned.

### [Rapier: 2D and 3D Physics Engines Focused on Performance][rapier-august]

[![Rapier logo](rapier-logo.svg)][Rapier]

[Rapier] is a new set of 2D and 3D physics engines written 100% in Rust.
It is 5 to 10 times faster than [nphysics], close to the performances of the
CPU version of PhysX, and often slightly faster than Box2D.

[For its first release][rapier-august] Rapier includes:

- rigid-body dynamics;
- colliders and sensors;
- joint constraints;
- optional serialization of the physics state;
- optional cross-platform determinism on IEEE-754 compliant targets;
- optional explicit SIMD and parallelism;
- JavaScript bindings with official NPM packages.

This new physics engine is developed by the recently created [Dimforge]
single-member Open-Source company [replacing][dimforge-replace] the former
Rustsim organization created on GitHub by [@sebcrozet].

### [NeoCogi's Libraries][neocogi-repo]

![Jude3D](jude3d.jpeg)

[Jude3D](https://neocogi.com) is a web based 3D sculpting application.
It's a WebAssembly application, written in C/C++ and compiled using Emscripten
but after much thinking, the authors decided to move the development to Rust!

Many problems arise when moving existing C/C++/WebAssembly code to Rust.
The two most important ones:

- The new code should still interop with the already existing code.
- Payload size matters on the web: your WASM app should be as small as possible.

These led the authors to drop using Rust's std in favor to their own libs (`!#[no_std]`),
at least until the std library crates are split up accordingly and stabilized,
for example, the `alloc` crate.

The good news is that they are
[releasing most of the libraries as they make them as open source][neocogi-repo]!
Also, a [WASM glfw3/GLES2 example][neocogi-example-src] that showcases the libs
is included ([live demo][neocogi-example-demo]).

### [cute-c2]

![cute-c2 collision](cute-c2-collision.gif)

cute-c2 is a 2D collision detection library that has had its first release to
[crates.io][cute-c2]. The library is a Rust wrapper around the [c2.h] library.

The library can detect collisions between circles, rectangles, capsules and
up to eight-sided convex polygons. There are also functions for manifold
generation, the GJK algorithm, and ray casting operations. There is an example
program in the repository.

### [hexasphere] v1.0

![hexasphere example gif](hexasphere.gif)

The [hexasphere] library provides a customizable interface for subdividing 3D
triangle meshes. Custom and stateful interpolation functions can be implemented
as well as per-vertex attributes.

All that's required to define a base shape are the initial vertices, triangles
based on the indices of the vertices in the initial vertices, and numbered
edges. As long as the winding of the triangles remains consistent throughout
the base mesh, all of the resulting triangles will retain that winding.

This library also provides a few interesting base shapes (which can be used alone
if the shape is not subdivided):
Icosahedron, Tetrahedron, Cube, Square Plane, Triangle Plane
(all of which are pictured above).

### [blitz-path](https://github.com/BezPowell/blitz-path)

[blitz-path](https://github.com/BezPowell/blitz-path) is a new crate providing
an implementation of the [JPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_point_search)
pathfinding algorithm.

JPS is an optimization of the A* search algorithm for uniform-cost grids, which
are common in games. While fully functional, the code is still in an early
state and any suggestions for improvements - especially on how best to
integrate it with the existing ecosystem - are greatly appreciated.

### [inline_tweak]

![Demo with moving traffic lights](inline-tweak.gif)

[inline_tweak] by [@Uriopass] is a library that allows you to
tweak at runtime any number literal directly from your code.
It works by parsing the file when a change occurs
(inspired by [this blogpost][tuxedolabs-post] from Tuxedo labs).
Usage example:

```rust
use inline_tweak::tweak;
loop {
    // Try changing the value while the application is running
    println!("{}", tweak!(3.14));
}
```

A `watch!()` macro that sleeps until the file is modified is also provided.

The library is minimal, only requiring the `lazy_static` dependency
to hold modified values.
In release mode, the tweaking code is disabled and compiled away.

### [yacurses]

[yacurses] by [@Lokathor] is a cross-platform curses bindings crate that's
small, simple, easy to understand, and most importantly safe to use.
It wraps over `ncurses` on Unix and a bundled `pdcurses` on Windows.
If you're looking to make a terminal-based roguelike
(or any other terminal-based game), give it a try.

### [SPIR-Q] v0.4.6

[SPIR-Q] is a light-weight shader reflection library, which allows you to query
the types, offsets, sizes and even names in your shaders procedurally.

This month v0.4.2..v0.4.6 versions were released.
Some of the updates:

- Specialization constants enumeration.
- Dynamically sized multi-binding support.
- Improved entrypoint debug printing.
- Better manifest merging method for pipeline construction.
- Bugfixes and various small API improvements.

### [Inline SPIR-V]

![inline-spirv](inline-spirv-demo.png)

[Inline SPIR-V] is a single-crate build-time shader compilation library based on
shaderc which provides procedural macros to help you translate shader sources,
in either GLSL or HLSL, inline or from-file, into SPIR-Vs and embed the SPIR-Vs
right inside your code as `u32` slices. Despite basic shader compilation,
`inline-spirv` also support `#include` directives, macro substitution,
post-compile optimization, as well as descriptor auto-binding.

### [rspirv-reflect] v0.1

![Traverse Research banner](traverse-research-banner.png)

[Traverse Research] has created the [rspirv-reflect] library to replace
their very basic use-case of the existing [spirv-reflect-rs] / [spirv-reflect]
libraries that are already out there. The current iteration of `rspirv-reflect`
is pretty minimal, but it allows you to extract the binding setup from a SPIR-V
binary. `rspirv-reflect` supports the latest version of SPIR-V (version 1.5 as
of writing) and it also supports all the new shader stages (both ray tracing
and mesh/task shaders) as well as the existing ones.

Traverse Research wanted to reduce their reliance on C and C++ unsafe
libraries and at the same time they needed to support newer features that were
slow to become available in the existing `spirv-reflect` library. The primary
use-case for this library is in conjunction with the Rust wrapper around the
DirectX Shader Compiler ([dxc]), called [hassle-rs] that Traverse Research
also built.

### [KAS] v0.5 and [KAS-text] v0.1

![KAS text layout](kas-text-layout.png)

[KAS] by [@dhardy] is a general purpose UI toolkit; its
initial aim is "old school" desktop apps with a good keyboard and touchscreen
support. Unlike many modern immediate-mode UIs, KAS's widgets retain state,
allowing minimal per-frame updates. KAS supports embedded WebGPU graphics now,
and will (eventually) support being embedded within other contexts (requiring
only a supply of input events and implementation of some basic graphics routines).

KAS v0.5 switches to a new crate for text layout,
[KAS-text]. KAS-text is a text layout
engine supporting multi-line editing, shaping and bidirectional text; future
versions will also support formatting. KAS-text is not tied to any particular
raster or render system; its positioned-glyph output is relatively easy to
adapt to crates like `wgpu_glyph` and `gfx_glyph`.
For more, see the article ["Why I created KAS-text"][kas-article].

### [Egui]

![Egui](egui.png)

[Egui] is a highly portable immediate mode GUI library in pure Rust.
Egui can be integrated anywhere you can paint textured triangles.
You can compile Egui to WASM and render it on a web page using [egui_web]
or compile and run natively using [egui_glium].

Check out the [Egui web demo](https://emilk.github.io/egui/index.html).

Example:

```rust
Window::new("Debug").show(ui.ctx(), |ui| {
    ui.label(format!("Hello, world {}", 123));
    if ui.button("Save").clicked {
        my_save_function();
    }
    ui.text_edit(&mut my_string);
    ui.add(Slider::f32(&mut value, 0.0..=1.0).text("float"));
});
```

### [voxel-mapper]

![Demo: some terrain painted as grass, snow, dirt, etc](voxel-mapper.jpeg)

[voxel-mapper] is a library and in-game editor for voxel maps, smooth or cubey.
The ultimate goal of the project is to make it easy for artists and programmers
alike to generate volumetric game content, either manually or procedurally.
The library's author [@bonsairobo] has also written a couple posts:

- ["Smooth Voxel Mapping: a Technical Deep Dive on Real-time Surface Nets and Texturing"][voxel-post-tech]
- ["A 3rd Person Camera in a Complex Voxel World"][voxel-post-cam]

Upcoming on the roadmap are procedural generation algorithms for generating
maps, new kinds of voxels, and graphical improvements. Currently, the library
and editor depend on the Amethyst engine version 0.15, but there is a desire to
make the library engine-agnostic. Contributions are welcome!

### [Bevy Engine][bevy]

[![bevy logo](bevy_logo.png)](https://bevyengine.org/)

[Bevy][bevy] by [@cart] is a brand new, refreshingly simple data-driven
game engine built in Rust. It aims to be:

- **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set.
- **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible
  for power users.
- **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using
  the Entity Component System paradigm.
- **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like.
- **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel.
- **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun.

These last few weeks have been big for the Bevy project:

- Bevy was announced and [open sourced on GitHub][bevy].
- Bevy's features were introduced in the ["Introducing Bevy"][bevy-intro]
  blog post.
- Had a staggering number of people join the community.
  This required some quick planning to handle the new size,
  which they outlined in the [Scaling Bevy][bevy-scaling] blog post.
- Added an official [awesome-bevy repo][awesome-bevy]
  with a huge number of community plugins, games, apps, and learning materials.
- Rapier, a new pure-rust physics engine,
  released an [official Bevy plugin][bevy-rapier].
- Thanks to the generosity of individuals and companies, they quickly met
  their first two funding goals on @cart's [Github Sponsors page][bevy-spnsors]:
  "sustainable development" and "@cart makes minimum wage working on Bevy".
- Bevy received a glowing review from the Amethyst Engine team and they agreed
  to collaborate in certain areas.
  See the [Addressing the Elephant in the Room][bevy-amethyst]
  thread on the Amethyst forum for more details.

Bevy users started sharing their work
on the [Bevy Discord showcase channel][bevy-discord-showcase]:

![bevy showcase](bevy_showcase.png)

In addition to the initial Bevy GitHub release, 114 pull requests
were merged this month. Some highlights:

- A custom [async task system for Bevy][bevy-pr-async],
  which significantly improves CPU usage and paves the way for future async work.
- Refactored data-driven ECS shader code to make it more maintainable, fix some bugs,
  and ready to be optimized via the ECS change detection apis.
- Support for "logical or" ECS queries as a compliment to the default "logical and".
- Numerous CI improvements.
- Use shaderc to compile shaders for iOS builds.
- GLTF loading improvements.

Bevy also made good progress on its three focus areas:

- [Editor-Ready UI](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/254)
- [Physically Based Rendering (PBR)](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/179)
- [Scenes](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/255)

### [Piston]

![text logo](piston-logo.png)

[Piston] is a modular game engine written in Rust.

A new [Piston Discord Channel] has been set up
for the Piston project.

Piston consists of a core library "piston" which itself are composed of
smaller libraries for abstracting input, window and event loop.
This design helps reducing breaking changes in the ecosystem.

The core library `pistoncore-input` is now stabilized and reached 1.0!
This is the most important core abstraction, because it glues all
libraries that are not independent of the core.

[Piston]: https://github.com/pistondevelopers/piston
[Piston Discord Channel]: https://discord.gg/TkDnS9x

------

[Dyon] is a rusty dynamically typed scripting language.
It is developed and maintained as part of the Piston project,
but can be used as a standalone library.

Dyon is designed from the bottom up to be a good gamedev scripting language for Rust.
It uses a lifetime checker instead of garbage collection, a mutability checker,
optional namespaces and ad-hoc types, named argument syntax,
4D vectors and HTML colors, plus a lot more features!

Recently, Dyon got better macro integration for native Rust types
using `#` as a prefix.
Here is an example of this feature is being tested in
an experimental offline 3D renderer (not open sourced):

```text
// Called by `set_simple(scene: _, sdf: _, id: _)`.
dyon_fn!{fn set_simple__scene_sdf_id(
    scene: #&mut SimpleScene,
    sdf: #&Sdf,
    id: f64
) {
    scene.sdfs[id as usize] = sdf.clone()
}}
```

[Piston-Graphics] is a library for 2D graphics, written in Rust,
that works with multiple backends.

`Stencil::Increment` has been added and the ecosystem
has been updated to the latest version.

[Piston-Graphics]: https://github.com/pistondevelopers/graphics

------

The research branch of the Piston project, AdvancedResearch,
has released a new ECS library [Nano-ECS].

This ECS design stores all components in a single array
and uses bit masks for enabling/disabling components.
An entity can have maximum 64 components and must be initialized
with all components it uses in the future.
Each entity has a slice into the array that stores all components.
The `World` object, `Component` and systems are generated using macros.

One research project with Nano-ECS is to prototype a UI framework
for Rust with a UI editor (not open sourced yet).
This project uses Piston-Graphics by default,
but can generate draw commands for processing by other 2D APIs.
It is also possible to override rendering of widgets for
custom looks with Piston-Graphics, which is often useful in gamedev.
Recently, this project has gotten to a place where
[tree-view interaction] is working.

You can follow development at [@PistonDeveloper at Twitter].
