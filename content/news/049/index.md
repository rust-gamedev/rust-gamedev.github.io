Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_A group of friends_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In August, Veloren saw a network library update, new locations in the character
selection screen, the implementation of a new portal graphic, and numerous
translation updates. Moreover, improvements were made to the airship fixes, loot
balancing, and group chat issues. There also been upgrades to the dependency, a
README update, and tweaks to the buff death message.

Ongoing projects currently in the works include the addition of Phoenix
abilities, NPC arenas, frost Giga attacks, compasses, and a banking storage
system. Other upcoming updates include an enhancement to the windmills, CI
scripts, saving window size, the selection of a single-player world, addition of
lava material, and improvements to the weather network protocol. Work is also
ongoing on ship movement, pet commands, Terracotta ruins, dwarven quarry,
coastal towns, clifftown rework, and axe skills. They are also planning to
implement physics interactions that increase your height when gliding, including
the introduction of thermal and ridgelines.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Failing to build P2P Multiplayer Pong with Bevy][chrisbiscardi-vid1]

[![multiplayer-pong](multiplayer-pong-fail.jpg)][chrisbiscardi-vid1]

[@chrisbiscardi] published a [video][chrisbiscardi-vid1] covering
P2P multiplayer games with rollback networking and physics.
This video dives into what makes it difficult and what parts
work out of the box before identifying better potential paths to take in the future.

## Tooling Updates

## Library Updates

### [Dexterous Developer][dexterous_developer]

[Dexterous Developer][dexterous_developer] by [@lee-orr]
is an experimental hot-reload system for the [Bevy] game engine.
Features:

- Define the reloadable areas of your game explicitly \- which can include
  systems, components, and resources (with some limitations).
- Reset resources to a default or pre-determined value upon reload.
- Serialize/deserialize your reloadable resources & components, allowing you to
  evolve their schemas so long as they are compatible with the de-serializer.
- Mark entities to get removed on hot reload.
- Run systems after hot-reload.
- Create functions to set-up & tear down upon either entering/exiting a state
  or on hot reload.
- Only includes any hot reload capacity in your build
  when you explicitly enable it - such as by using the CLI launcher.
- Cross-platform/cross-device hot reload - run a "hot reload server"
  on a dev environment, and execute the application elsewhere.

The library is quite new and currently known issues include:
mobile/WASM support and the need to pre-define events&states.
