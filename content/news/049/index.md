Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Graviton - The Great Sand Simulator][graviton-steam]

![Graviton Sand Simulator Image](graviton.gif)

[Graviton - The Great Sand Simulator][graviton-website]
([Discord][graviton-discord], [Youtube][graviton-youtube])
by [@hakolao] is a falling sand simulator in which you can define
your own interactive sand rules.

Continuing the developer's exploration into GPU sand simulation
the app has been recently taken to another level with a complete rewrite.
Now, with some [training][graviton-docs],
you can program your own rules for the sand.
Many example sands are provided from acid and blood to the classic
Game of Life.

Recent updates include:

- Customizable sand with programmable rules.
- [Shape & Mirror Draw Modes][graviton-youtube-mirror].
- New UI, graphics and render modes.
- Gif and Image export.
- Image import.

You can support the development by purchasing or wishlisting on
[Steam][graviton-steam].

In August, [a new version of the demo build has been released][tunnet-post].
Here are the most notable updates:

- The game is now better optimized to run smoothly on the Steam Deck.
- Some of the textures have been revamped and are now slightly more detailed.
- The animations of the character portraits have been improved.

### [Oort]

![Asteroids-like vector graphics with ships and missiles
made out of simple geometric forms](oort.png)
_A fleet of ships_

[Oort] ([GitHub][oort-gh], [Discord][oort-dis]) by [@rlane] is a programming
game where you write Rust code to control space ships in combat against other
players. Your code needs to manage the thrusters, guns, missiles, comms, and
radar of each ship in your fleet. There's a series of tutorials where you can
solve key problems one by one, such as leading moving targets or missile
guidance. The game runs in your browser via WebAssembly.

Oort has started running weekly tournaments and the AIs have gotten more and more
sophisticated each time. Check out this recent [tournament writeup][oort-tournament]
where the top players discuss their strategies.

### [Ars Militaris][arsm]

![Ars Militaris Logo](arsmilitaris.png)

[Ars Militaris][arsm] ([GitHub][arsm-gh], [Discord][arsm-dis],
[Twitter][arsm-twi], [Reddit][arsm-red])
is a turn-based tactics game set in the ancient Rome era,
being developed with Bevy.

August saw some nice developments that occurred in both the
digital and board game version of Ars Militaris. You can
read about them in issues VI through IX of This Week in Ars Militaris
([VI](https://arsmilitaris.com#this-week-in-ars-militaris-vi),
[VII](https://arsmilitaris.com#this-week-in-ars-militaris-vii),
[VIII](https://arsmilitaris.com#this-week-in-ars-militaris-viii),
[IX](https://arsmilitaris.com#this-week-in-ars-militaris-ix)).

The most noticeable improvements in the digital version were
the updating of the multiplayer aspect to be on par with the
single-player aspect, and then also the development of the
[Ars Militaris Lobby][arsm-lobby].

In the board game version, development started on a new
scenario that will serve as our main product for the Ars
Militaris board game version, and much playtesting with
very positive results occurred
[(Ars Militaris Event III)][arsm-event-iii]
and [(Ars Militaris Event IV)][arsm-event-iv].

But then, the result of a somewhat intensive 3-month
sprint left the Lead Developer exhausted which brought
the project to a temporary pause.

### [Veloren][veloren]

![Veloren a group of friends](veloren.jpg)
_A group of friends_

[Veloren][veloren] is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.

In August, Veloren saw a network library update, new locations in the character
selection screen, the implementation of a new portal graphic, and numerous
translation updates. Moreover, improvements were made to the airship fixes, loot
balancing, and group chat issues. There also been upgrades to the dependency, a
README update, and tweaks to the buff death message.

Ongoing projects currently in the works include the addition of Phoenix
abilities, NPC arenas, frost Giga attacks, compasses, and a banking storage
system. Other upcoming updates include an enhancement to the windmills, CI
scripts, saving window size, the selection of a single-player world, addition of
lava material, and improvements to the weather network protocol. Work is also
ongoing on ship movement, pet commands, Terracotta ruins, dwarven quarry,
coastal towns, clifftown rework, and axe skills. They are also planning to
implement physics interactions that increase your height when gliding, including
the introduction of thermal and ridgelines.

## Learning Material Updates

### [Failing to build P2P Multiplayer Pong with Bevy][chrisbiscardi-vid1]

[![multiplayer-pong](multiplayer-pong-fail.jpg)][chrisbiscardi-vid1]

[@chrisbiscardi] published a [video][chrisbiscardi-vid1] covering
P2P multiplayer games with rollback networking and physics.
This video dives into what makes it difficult and what parts
work out of the box before identifying better potential paths to take in the future.

### Mobile Development with Bevy

[@Nikl][nikl] published two blog posts on the topic of mobile development
using Bevy. [The first post][mobile-bevy-post] concentrates on getting
builds ready for the Apple and Google App stores. It outlines how to
use the tool [x-build][x-build] to create Android App bundles and some
required changes to get iOS builds accepted by the App store.

[A second post][android-workflow] documents how to set up and configure
a GitHub workflow to automate releases of a Bevy application to the
Google Play Store.

## Tooling Updates

### [Space editor](space_editor)

![Space editor window with opened level](space_editor.png)

[Space editor](space_editor) is an editor designed for Bevy engine
that simplifies level and object template creation. Here are its key features:

- Intuitive UI is built on top of bevy-inspector-egui and egui-gizmo
  to easy objects manipulate.
- It supports the bevy_xpbd physics library,
  making customizing collider positions faster than ever.
- Run your levels directly from the editor.
  This enables quick and efficient development iteration.
- Save your levels and object templates in the standard Bevy scene format
  and spawn in game with just one line of code.
- Many custom structures that allow to customize saved scenes
  equally conveniently, both via gui and directly editing the saved text file.

The [GitHub project][space_editor] is free for use
and open to contribute for everyone, be it with suggestions, bugs or PRs.

## Library Updates

### [Dexterous Developer][dexterous_developer]

[Dexterous Developer][dexterous_developer] by [@lee-orr]
is an experimental hot-reload system for the [Bevy] game engine.
Features:

- Define the reloadable areas of your game explicitly \- which can include
  systems, components, and resources (with some limitations).
- Reset resources to a default or pre-determined value upon reload.
- Serialize/deserialize your reloadable resources & components, allowing you to
  evolve their schemas so long as they are compatible with the de-serializer.
- Mark entities to get removed on hot reload.
- Run systems after hot-reload.
- Create functions to set-up & tear down upon either entering/exiting a state
  or on hot reload.
- Only includes any hot reload capacity in your build
  when you explicitly enable it - such as by using the CLI launcher.
- Cross-platform/cross-device hot reload - run a "hot reload server"
  on a dev environment, and execute the application elsewhere.

The library is quite new and currently known issues include:
mobile/WASM support and the need to pre-define events&states.
