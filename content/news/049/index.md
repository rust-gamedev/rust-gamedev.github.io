Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Mobile Development with Bevy

[@Nikl][nikl] published two blog posts on the topic of mobile development
using Bevy. [The first post][mobile-bevy-post] concentrates on getting
builds ready for the Apple and Google App stores. It outlines how to
use the tool [x-build][x-build] to create Android App bundles and some
required changes to get iOS builds accepted by the App store.

[A second post][android-workflow] documents how to set up and configure
a GitHub workflow to automate releases of a Bevy application to the
Google Play Store.
