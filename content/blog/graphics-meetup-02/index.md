## Schedule

### Vismut | [Lukas Orsvärn]

#### 16:00 - 16:20

> Vismut will be a procedural texturing tool for Windows and Linux, allowing for
> a 100% non-destructive material creation workflow. This means you build
> textures from scratch using procedural nodes, allowing for changes to any step
> in the process at any time, including changing the texture's resolution.

### Screen-13 | [John Wells]

#### 16:20 - 16:30

> Screen 13 is an easy-to-use Vulkan rendering engine in the spirit of QBasic.

### Optimizing wgpu with Data Driven Design | [Connor Fitzgerald]

#### 16:30 - 17:00

> A look into how Data Driven Design is the key to the performance increases
> coming in wgpu 0.13 and what the future holds for solving long standing
> performance bottlenecks in the codebase. wgpu is the graphics abstraction at
> the core of many rust projects and ensuring it is as fast as possible will
> push the boundary of what is possible in safe Rust today.
